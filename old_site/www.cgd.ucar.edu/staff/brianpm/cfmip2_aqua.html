			--> <h1>Using aquaplanets to
			understand cloud effects in GCMs</h1>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Aquaplanets are Earth-like planets with a completely water-covered surface. This
			configuration has been used for a variety of applications in atmospheric and climate
			science, with some of its advantages discussed
			by Hoskins et al. (1999). The attractiveness
			of this simplified geography was also
			recognized by Lorenz, who wrote in
			1967: 
			  <BLOCKQUOTE><i>Within the collection of
			possible planetary atmospheres, one which is  
devoid of irregularities occupies a more central and fundamental position 
than one with any speciﬁc arrangement of irregularities.</i></BLOCKQUOTE>
			<img src="figures/ncar_globes.png"
			alt="progression to an aquaplanet" id="fig1" name="fig1" width="450" border="1" align="right" />
			Aquaplanets have recently been used to
			investigate climate sensitivity of atmospheric
			general circulation models (Miura et al. 2005,
			Medeiros et al. 2008).   
                       
                        Medeiros et al. (2008) use two GCMs to show
                        that aquaplanets have similar tropical
                        climate sensitivity as the more Earth-like
                        configurations of the same models. This is
                        suggested to be caused by similar low-cloud
                        response in near-tropical latitudes in the
                        Earth-like and aquaplanet configurations. This
                        makes the aquaplanet a useful framework for
                        model intercomparison of cloud effects. </p>
			<p>The
                        advantage of the aquaplanet configuration is
                        the relative simplicity. Removing zonal
                        asymmetry makes zonal averages meaningful,
                        reducing the dimensionality of the
                        analysis. Similarly, aquaplanets that are
                        symmetric about the equator double the
                        sampling for every latitude. The configuration
                        recommended below removes seasonal variation
                        and sea-ice as well as land and SST
                        asymmetries, which also
                        allows for quite short integrations since all
                        the slowly varying components of the system
                        are controlled. Finally, the aquaplanet can be
                        used to isolate particular regimes. With the
                        configuration discussed here, for example, the
                        descending branch of the Hadley circulation is
                        populated by trade wind cumulus conditions,
                        without the effects of stratocumulus. This
                        isolation allows increased sampling of
                        particular regimes, providing robust
                        statistics, and an idealized laboratory
                        for understanding, e.g., tropical cloud effects.
			</p>
			<p> Provided below are the requirements and
			recommendations for designing aquaplanet
			configurations comparable to those discussed
			in Medeiros et al. (2008). To simplify the
			climate perturbation, the recommended approach is to 
			use a straightforward, global
			increase in SST. This yields similar
			results as those discussed in the paper, and
			retains the baroclinicity of the
			midlatitudes. <b>The CMIP requirement is for three simulations: (1) a control aquaplanet, (2) a 4x CO2 simulation, and (3) a SST+4K simulation. [<a href="http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/">CMIP5</a>]</b>
			</p>
			<h2>Design Requirements</h2>
			<p> The basic requirements are simply to
			create an aquaplanet configuration following
			the <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~mike/APE/">Aqua-Planet Intercomparison Project.</a></p>
                        <ul>
			  <li> Constant SST, symmetric about equator
			    and zonally, following the APE "Qobs"
			    functional form: <img src="http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~brianpm/download/qobs_eqn.png"
			    alt="qobs" width="500px"> <br>where Tmax = 27 C.</li>
			  <li> Constant equinox orbital conditions,
			  including diurnal variation.</li>
			  <li> No sea-ice.</li>
                          <li> Model runs should be at least 60 months (5 years).</li>
			  <li>Radiatively active gases symmetric
			  about equator and zonally. See recommended
			  values below.</li>
			  <li>Aerosol removed, or made symmetric with
			  oceanic values.</li>
			  <li><b>CLIMATE CHANGE:</b> Global SST
			  increase of 4K. <br> Note this represents a
                        change from previous experiments using 2K. The
                       larger perturbation is being recommended to
                        evoke a larger model response.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Design Recommendations</h2>
			<p>These are additional recommendations to
			make contributions more homogeneous.</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Constituent gas mixing ratios follow
			  AMIP II: <BR>
CO2: 348ppmv;<BR> 
CH4: 1650 ppbv; <BR>
N2O: 306 ppbv; <BR>
Halocarbon yield ~0.24 W m-2 radiative forcing.</li>
			  <li>Ozone following values for APE
			  (examples:
			  (<a
			  href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~mike/APE/ape_ozone.html">A</a>),
			  (<a href="http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/~brianpm/download/apeozone.nc">B</a>))</li>
			  <li> No radiatively active aerosol.</li>
			  <li> Solar constant equal to 1365 W m-2.</li>
			  <li> Recommended atmospheric mass and
			  physical constants from APE (<a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/pro
	     jects/amip/ape/">link</a>).</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Output</h2> <p>The model output should
			follow recommendations for CFMIP-2, including
			satellite emulator packages
			(<a href="http://www.cfmip.net/">link</a>)
			and with high-frequency (30min/timestep) output every 2.5 degrees of latitude along 0 degrees longitude.  Previous studies (e.g., Medeiros et
			al. 2008) have principally used monthly mean
			output, but experience suggests daily mean
			output can provide a deeper look into the
			various cloud-related distributions. High-frequency output can be used for process-level studies as well as for driving column models, cloud system resolving models, and LES.
