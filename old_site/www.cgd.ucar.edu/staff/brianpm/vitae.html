  <h1>Current State</h1>
  <br />
  <p> I am a Project Scientist II in CGD
  at NCAR. <br>
  I develop and use idealized frameworks in
  climate models, in particular the
  Community Earth System Model (and
  Community Atmosphere Model). These
  include the CAPT framework (aka
  forecast mode), aquaplanets,
  radiative-convective equilibrium, and
  single-column models.<br />

   <h1>Past States<a class="bdy" id="past" name="past"></a></h1>
   <p>While at UC Berkeley, I worked with
   Rich Muller's Astrogeophysics group and studied paleoclimate. During
   that time I worked primarily on two topics. First, I did analysis of
   "high frequency" (i.e., 1500 y) climate oscillations. The second project was the
   construction of a time series called the <a class="bdy"
   href="http://muller.lbl.gov/papers/BenthicStack.pdf">Benthic
   Stack</a>, which was published in <a class="bdy" 
   href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2002/2001PA000667.shtml">Paleoceanography
   in 2002</a>.</p>

<p>My first project in graduate school was an investigation of the processes that control the mean
depth of the planetary boundary layer. I analyzed output from the UCLA
GCM and a simple mixed layer mass budget analysis to understand the
land-sea contrast in PBL depth, including a simple analytical model of
the diurnal cycle of the convective (dry) mixed layer. This work was
supervised by Alex Hall and Bjorn Stevens, and the paper can be
downloaded in the <a class="bdy" href="pubs.html">Publications</a>
section.</p>
<p>My dissertation continued analysis of climate models to better
understand cloud feedbacks. I used the NCAR CAM3 and GFDL AM2 as
idealized aquaplanets under idealized climate change (prescribed
surface warming). Upon completing my PhD at UCLA, I became
a post-doctoral researcher in Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic
Sciences at UCLA, where I continued to work in <a class="bdy"
href="http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/%7ebstevens">Bjorn Stevens'</a>
research group. Although affiliated with UCLA, my work was funded by
the Center for Multiscale Modeling of Atmospheric Processes (<a
 class="bdy" href="http://www.cmmap.org">CMMAP</a>), based in Fort
Collins, Colorado. During 2007-2009 I lived in Fort Collins, and was
graciously hosted at CMMAP by Dave Randall. During this time my
research continued to focus on isolating and understanding low-cloud effects on
climate using numerical models, but also expanded to analysis of
satellite observations of tropical clouds.</p>
