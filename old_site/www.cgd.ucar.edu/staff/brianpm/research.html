Clouds embody complicated, delicate interactions of atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics, which come together to substantially alter the state of the atmosphere. Because so many scales are involved, from sub-millimeter (e.g. nucleation) to thousands of kilometers (e.g. planetary-scale waves), from seconds to years, the representation of clouds in climate models is challenging, and has remained a source of uncertainty in projections of future climate. My work uses these models to try to (1) better understand how clouds interact with the climate system and (2) to improve the representation of clouds in climate models.</p>	    <p class="container">One of the fundamental questions I want to help answer is simply, <em>In a changing climate, how will clouds change?</em> It's a simple question, but as yet we do not have an answer.</p>    <p class="container">Some general interests that are related include: moist convection in various regimes (e.g., stratocumulus, shallow convection, and deep, precipitating convection), surface-atmosphere interaction, boundary layer processes, the hydrologic cycle, climate feedbacks (&amp; climate sensitivity/stability), and climate modeling.</p></div></section><section class="module parallax parallax-3"><div class="container">  <h2>Themes</h2></div></section><section class="module content"><div class="container"><ul>  <li> <b class="sc2">Low-level clouds.</b></li>  <p>Low clouds remain  at the heart of "uncertainty" in estimates of climate  sensitivity. Essentially all of my research is centered on the  role of low-level clouds connected to the boundary layer in the  climate system. I'm cheifly interested in tropical clouds, like  subtropical stratocumulus decks and the ubiquitous shallow cumulus  that cover the oceans, but I am also interested in their  land-based and extratropical relatives. </p>  <li> <b class="sc2">Boundary layers and turbulence.</b></li>  <p>The  low-clouds that I am interested in are connected to turbulent  boundary layers. To understand the clouds requires understanding  the structure of the boundary layer. Boundary layers come in many  forms, and play an important part of our everyday interaction with  the weather, which includes impacts on air quality. </p>  <li> <b class="sc2">Isolating regime behavior.</b></li>  <p>Many  studies are published that seem to expect climate models to  reproduce observations precisely. The reality is that all climate  models have biases, some severe, which can substantially change  when and where particular phenomena occur. Rather than focusing on  specific time intervals or pre-determined geographical regions, I  like to explore the physics of the climate models by isolating  meteorological conditions in which my targeted phenomena occur  (e.g., stratocumulus decks). A prominent example in my work is  using large-scale conditions to isolate different low-cloud  regimes ([<a class="bdy" href="aquaplanet_paper.1">LINK</a>], [<a  class="bdy" href="evalpaper">LINK</a>]), but I apply similar  thinking in a study of the strength of the Arctic inversion  strength [<a class="bdy" href="arctic_inversion_paper">LINK</a>].  </p>  <li> <b class="sc2">Idealized modeling frameworks.</b></li>  <p>My  focus has been on trying to understand climate phenomena in  idealized GCM configurations. This goes back to my work with the  UCLA GCM with constant sunshine [<a class="bdy"  href="depth_paper.1">LINK</a>], which also employed a simple bulk  boundary layer model, but continues to my current projects using  GCMs in aquaplanet configurations and with a short-term forecast  approach. </p>  <li> <b class="sc2">Model evaluation with observations.</b></li>  <p>Examples include our  work to show that simplified aquaplanets can be directly compared  with observations [<a class="bdy" href="evalpaper">LINK</a>]. This  is also related to my work with the space-based lidar on CALIPSO  [<a bdy="class" href="calipso_paper">LINK</a>], and my  contribution to ongoing work with satellite simulators in CAM [<a  class="bdy"  href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00469.1">LINK</a>]. </p></ul></div></section><section class="module parallax parallax-2"><div class="container">  <h2>Projects</h2></div></section><section class="module content"><div class="container">  <p>&#9729; Evaluating climate models using a  short-term forecast framework (known as CAPT or Transpose  AMIP).
