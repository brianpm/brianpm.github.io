    <h1 id="how-i-open-jupyter-on-cgd-machines">How I open jupyter on CGD
        machines</h1>
    <h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>working conda (or mamba) environment(s) on CGD systems.</li>
        <li>environment(s) need to have jupyter server libraries installed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="set-up">Set up</h2>
    <p>The steps are simple:
    <ul>
        <li>If remote: start VPN - SSH to one of the CGD
            servers (magnolia, topaz, andre, etc.)</li>
        <li>activate the environment you
            want to be using</li>
        <li>go to your code repository/directory</li>
        <li>start jupyter server</li>
        <li>from your computer, open ssh tunnel to the server - open
            jupyter in your local browser</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="details">A detailed example:</h2>
    <pre><code>ssh yourusername@cgdservername.cgd.ucar.edu
conda activate your_environment
cd /your/code/repository
jupyter lab --port=8899 --no-browser</code></pre>
    <p>Back on your local machine:</p>
    <pre><code>ssh -N -f -L 8899:localhost:8899 yourusername@cgdservername.cgd.ucar.edu</code></pre>
    <p><em>Note:</em> the default port that Jupyter wants to use is 8888,
        but I often found that port was already being used on one machine or the
        other, so I just arbitrarily changed to 8899.</p>
    <p>Go to browser and enter into the address bar:</p>
    <pre><code>localhost:8899</code></pre>
    <p>You will likely get an authentication page:</p> <img src="./images/jupyter_login_screen.png"
        alt="jupyter login page" width="500" />
    <p>In
        this case, go back to your original ssh session in the first terminal
        window (where you started the jupyter server). It’ll look something
        like: <img src="./images/jupyter_server_running.png" alt="terminal running jupyter server" width="500" /></p>
    <p>Copy the token string and put it into the browser field.</p>
    <p>That should authenticate you, and jupyter lab will open. At this
        point, leave those <strong>two terminal sessions open</strong> and
        interact with jupyter through the browser.</p>
    <h2 id="shutting-down">Shutting Down</h2>
    <p>When you are done, the shutdown procedure is easy. - In the browser,
        in the jupyter interface go to “File” and at the bottom select “Log Out”
        or “Shut Down” - If you select “Log Out” that does not shut down the
        server, and you can log back into it. - If you select “Shut Down” that
        should log you out and also shut down the server. - At any time, you can
        shut down the server by going to your first session and pressing
        <code>Ctrl+C</code>, and then enter “y” when asked if you really want to
        shut down the server. You can also hit <code>Ctrl+C</code> again, and I
        think it’ll shut down. - To close that ssh tunnel, go back to any local
        terminal and run <code>ps aux | grep &lt;port number&gt;</code> to
        identify the process ID, and then run <code>kill -9 [PID]</code>
