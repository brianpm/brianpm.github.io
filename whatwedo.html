		<p class="para1">I am interested in the role that clouds play in the climate system. Clouds embody complicated, delicate interactions of atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics, which come together to substantially alter the state of the atmosphere. Because so many scales are involved, from sub-millimeter (e.g. nucleation) to thousands of kilometers (e.g. planetary-scale waves), from seconds to years, the representation of clouds in climate models is challenging, and has remained a source of uncertainty in projections of future climate. My work uses these models to try to (1) better understand how clouds interact with the climate system and (2) to improve the representation of clouds in climate models. </p>

					      Climate models provide our best available tools for understanding the behaviors of the climate system. These complicated geophysical models are designed, tested, and tuned with the goal of reproducing the real climate system. Their utility is best exhibited by carefully designed experiments that expose fundamental behavior. That behavior may elucidate real physical behavior of the climate system or peculiar model behavior. Both are useful for different reasons. In my work, I try to contrive numerical experiments that help me understand both how the real world works and how the model works; occasionally those are the same thing.

					      I try to use quantitative methods that have practical explanatory power. That is, I use the methods that I think best convey physical understanding. Often these are simple but powerful statistics. Many of the problems I deal with end up with multi-dimensional data, and the challenge is to compress the data to a manageable degree.

					      I help to make it easier to configure the CESM in unconventional ways. For example, a recent project helped to make the "aquaplanet" configuration of CESM much more user friendly. I also try to develop diagnostics and visualizations that go beyond some of the "industry standards." I also collaborate and consult with researchers around the world who are interested in these configurations and approaches.
