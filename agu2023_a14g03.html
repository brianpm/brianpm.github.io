    <h1 id="AGU">Tightening the belt</h1>
    <h2 id="subtitle">investigating the impact of high resolution at reduced computational cost</h2>

    <h2> Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>I want to thank Max Bouman for his efforts to develop detection and tracking for both tropical cyclones and mesoscale convective systems.</p>

    <p>John Truesdale ran the TRBELT simulation and was crucial in getting the configuration to work.</p>

    <p>Patrick Callaghan developed the <a href="https://github.com/ESMCI/Community_Mesh_Generation_Toolkit">Community Mesh Generation Toolkit</a> that was used to generate the mesh and the various files need to run CAM with a custom grid. </p>

    <p>Adam Herrington, Peter Laurtizen, and Rich Neale provided intput on the design of the grid and other aspects of the project.</p>

    <p>This project was supported primarily under Catalyst, a DOE-funded project in the RGMA program.  The project was also supported by the National Science Foundation through their sponsorship of NCAR. </p>

    <h2>Slide Download</h2>
    A pdf copy of the slides that were presented at AGU is available: <a href="../provide-files/medeiros_agu_final.pdf"></a>

    <h2>Additional Resources</h2>
    I'm planning to provide a link to the eventual paper documenting this configuration and code repository for analysis once they are available.
