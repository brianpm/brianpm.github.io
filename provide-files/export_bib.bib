	Abstract = {Precipitation distributions and extremes play a fundamental role in shaping Earth's climate and yet are poorly represented in many global climate models. Here, a suite of idealized Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) aquaplanet simulations is examined to assess the aquaplanet's ability to reproduce hydroclimate statistics of real-Earth configurations and to investigate sensitivities of precipitation distributions and extremes to model physics, horizontal grid resolution, and ocean type. Little difference in precipitation statistics is found between aquaplanets using time-constant sea-surface temperatures and those implementing a slab ocean model with a 50 m mixed-layer depth. In contrast, CAM version 5.3 (CAM5.3) produces more time mean, zonally averaged precipitation than CAM version 4 (CAM4), while CAM4 generates significantly larger precipitation variance and frequencies of extremely intense precipitation events. The largest model configuration-based precipitation sensitivities relate to choice of horizontal grid resolution in the selected range 1--2$\,^{\circ}$. Refining grid resolution has significant physics-dependent effects on tropical precipitation: for CAM4, time mean zonal mean precipitation increases along the Equator and the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) narrows, while for CAM5.3 precipitation decreases along the Equator and the twin branches of the ITCZ shift poleward. Increased grid resolution also reduces light precipitation frequencies and enhances extreme precipitation for both CAM4 and CAM5.3 resulting in better alignment with observational estimates. A discussion of the potential implications these hydrologic cycle sensitivities have on the interpretation of precipitation statistics in future climate projections is also presented.},

	Abstract = { Abstract In moist convection, atmospheric motions transport water vapor from the earth's surface to the regions where condensation occurs. This transport is associated with three other aspects of convection: the latent heat transport, the expansion work performed by water vapor, and the irreversible entropy production due to diffusion of water vapor and phase changes. An analysis of the thermodynamic transformations of atmospheric water yields what is referred to as the entropy budget of the water substance, providing a quantitative relationship between these three aspects of moist convection. The water vapor transport can be viewed as an imperfect heat engine that produces less mechanical work than the corresponding Carnot cycle because of diffusion of water vapor and irreversible phase changes. The entropy budget of the water substance provides an alternative method of determining the irreversible entropy production due to phase changes and diffusion of water vapor. This method has the advantage that it does not require explicit knowledge of the relative humidity or of the molecular flux of water vapor for the estimation of the entropy production. Scaling arguments show that the expansion work of water vapor accounts for a small fraction of the work that would be produced in the absence of irreversible moist processes. It is also shown that diffusion of water vapor and irreversible phase changes can be interpreted as the irreversible counterpart to the continuous dehumidification resulting from condensation and precipitation. This leads to a description of moist convection where it acts more as an atmospheric dehumidifier than as a heat engine. },

@article{Pauluis:2002,
	Abstract = { Abstract The entropy budget of an atmosphere in radiative--convective equilibrium is analyzed here. The differential heating of the atmosphere, resulting from surface heat fluxes and tropospheric radiative cooling, corresponds to a net entropy sink. In statistical equilibrium, this entropy sink is balanced by the entropy production due to various irreversible processes such as frictional dissipation, diffusion of heat, diffusion of water vapor, and irreversible phase changes. Determining the relative contribution of each individual irreversible process to the entropy budget can provide important information on the behavior of convection. The entropy budget of numerical simulations with a cloud ensemble model is discussed. In these simulations, it is found that the dominant irreversible entropy source is associated with irreversible phase changes and diffusion of water vapor. In addition, a large fraction of the frictional dissipation results from falling precipitation, and turbulent dissipation accounts for only a small fraction of the entropy production. This behavior is directly related to the fact that the convective heat transport is mostly due to the latent heat transport. In such cases, moist convection acts more as an atmospheric dehumidifier than as a heat engine. The amount of work available to accelerate convective updrafts and downdrafts is much smaller than predicted by studies that assume that moist convection behaves mostly as a perfect heat engine. },

	Abstract = { Abstract Buoyancy and velocity scales for dry convection in statistical equilibrium were derived in the early twentieth century by Prandtl, but the scaling of convective velocity and buoyancy, as well as the fractional area coverage of convective clouds, is still unresolved for moist convection. In this paper, high-resolution simulations of an atmosphere in radiative--convective equilibrium are performed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic, convection-resolving, limited-area model. The velocity and buoyancy scales for moist convection in statistical equilibrium are characterized by prescribing different constant cooling rates to the system. It is shown that the spatiotemporal properties of deep moist convection and buoyancy and velocity scales at equilibrium depend on the terminal velocity of raindrops and a hypothesis is developed to explain this behavior. This hypothesis is evaluated and discussed in the context of the numerical results provided by the WRF model. The influence of domain size on radiative--convective equilibrium statistics is also assessed. The dependence of finescale spatiotemporal properties of convective structures on numerical and physical details is investigated. },

@article{Newman:2012,
	Abstract = { AbstractThe relative contributions to mean global atmospheric moisture transport by both the time-mean circulation and by synoptic and low-frequency (periods greater than 10 days) anomalies are evaluated from the vertically integrated atmospheric moisture budget based on 40 yr of ``chi corrected'' NCEP--NCAR reanalysis data. In the extratropics, while the time-mean circulation primarily moves moisture zonally within ocean basins, low-frequency and synoptic anomalies drive much of the mean moisture transport both from ocean to land and toward the poles. In particular, during the cool-season low-frequency variability is the largest contributor to mean moisture transport into southwestern North America, Europe, and Australia. While some low-frequency transport originates in low latitudes, much is of extratropical origin due to large-scale atmospheric anomalies that extract moisture from the northeast Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Low-frequency variability is also integral to the Arctic (latitudes > 70$\,^{\circ}$N) mean moisture budget, especially during summer, when it drives mean poleward transport from relatively wet high-latitude continental regions. Synoptic variability drives about half of the mean poleward moisture transport in the midlatitudes of both hemispheres, consistent with simple ``lateral mixing'' arguments. Extratropical atmospheric transport is also particularly focused within ``atmospheric rivers'' (ARs), relatively narrow poleward-moving moisture plumes associated with frontal dynamics. AR moisture transport, defined by compositing fluxes over those locations and times where column-integrated water vapor and poleward low-level wind anomalies are both positive, represents most of the total extratropical meridional moisture transport. These results suggest that understanding potential anthropogenic changes in the earth 's hydrological cycle may require understanding corresponding changes in atmospheric variability, especially on low-frequency time scales. },

@article{Magnusson:2014,
	Abstract = { AbstractOn 30 October 2012 Hurricane Sandy made landfall on the U.S. East Coast with a devastating impact. Here the performance of the ECMWF forecasts (both high resolution and ensemble) are evaluated together with ensemble forecasts from other numerical weather prediction centers, available from The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive. The sensitivity to sea surface temperature (SST) and model resolution for the ECMWF forecasts are explored. The results show that the ECMWF forecasts provided a clear indication of the landfall from 7 days in advance. Comparing ensemble forecasts from different centers, the authors find the ensemble forecasts from ECMWF to be the most consistent in the forecast of the landfall of Sandy on the New Jersey coastline. The impact of the warm SST anomaly off the U.S. East Coast is investigated by running sensitivity experiments with climatological SST instead of persisting the SST anomaly from the analysis. The results show that the SST anomaly had a small effect on Sandy's track in the forecast, but the forecasts initialized with the warm SST anomaly feature a more intense system in terms of the depth of the cyclone, wind speeds, and precipitation. Furthermore, the role of spatial resolution is investigated by comparing four global simulations, spanning from TL159 (150 km) to TL3999 (5 km) horizontal resolution. Forecasts from 3 and 5 days before the landfall are evaluated. While all resolutions predict Sandy's landfall, at very high resolution the tropical cyclone intensity and the oceanic wave forecasts are greatly improved. },

	Abstract = {There is a tremendous desire to attribute causes to weather and climate events that is often challenging from a physical standpoint. Headlines attributing an event solely to either human-induced climate change or natural variability can be misleading when both are invariably in play. The conventional attribution framework struggles with dynamically driven extremes because of the small signal-to-noise ratios and often uncertain nature of the forced changes. Here, we suggest that a different framing is desirable, which asks why such extremes unfold the way they do. Specifically, we suggest that it is more useful to regard the extreme circulation regime or weather event as being largely unaffected by climate change, and question whether known changes in the climate system's thermodynamic state affected the impact of the particular event. Some examples briefly illustrated include 'snowmaggedon' in February 2010, superstorm Sandy in October 2012 and supertyphoon Haiyan in November 2013, and, in more detail, the Boulder floods of September 2013, all of which were influenced by high sea surface temperatures that had a discernible human component.},

@article{Soden:2008,
	Abstract = { Abstract The extent to which the climate will change due to an external forcing depends largely on radiative feedbacks, which act to amplify or damp the surface temperature response. There are a variety of issues that complicate the analysis of radiative feedbacks in global climate models, resulting in some confusion regarding their strengths and distributions. In this paper, the authors present a method for quantifying climate feedbacks based on ``radiative kernels'' that describe the differential response of the top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes to incremental changes in the feedback variables. The use of radiative kernels enables one to decompose the feedback into one factor that depends on the radiative transfer algorithm and the unperturbed climate state and a second factor that arises from the climate response of the feedback variables. Such decomposition facilitates an understanding of the spatial characteristics of the feedbacks and the causes of intermodel differences. This technique provides a simple and accurate way to compare feedbacks across different models using a consistent methodology. Cloud feedbacks cannot be evaluated directly from a cloud radiative kernel because of strong nonlinearities, but they can be estimated from the change in cloud forcing and the difference between the full-sky and clear-sky kernels. The authors construct maps to illustrate the regional structure of the feedbacks and compare results obtained using three different model kernels to demonstrate the robustness of the methodology. The results confirm that models typically generate globally averaged cloud feedbacks that are substantially positive or near neutral, unlike the change in cloud forcing itself, which is as often negative as positive. },

@article{Stott:2016,
	Abstract = {Extreme weather and climate-related events occur in a particular place, by definition, infrequently. It is therefore challenging to detect systematic changes in their occurrence given the relative shortness of observational records. However, there is a clear interest from outside the climate science community in the extent to which recent damaging extreme events can be linked to human-induced climate change or natural climate variability. Event attribution studies seek to determine to what extent anthropogenic climate change has altered the probability or magnitude of particular events. They have shown clear evidence for human influence having increased the probability of many extremely warm seasonal temperatures and reduced the probability of extremely cold seasonal temperatures in many parts of the world. The evidence for human influence on the probability of extreme precipitation events, droughts, and storms is more mixed. Although the science of event attribution has developed rapidly in recent years, geographical coverage of events remains patchy and based on the interests and capabilities of individual research groups. The development of operational event attribution would allow a more timely and methodical production of attribution assessments than currently obtained on an ad hoc basis. For event attribution assessments to be most useful, remaining scientific uncertainties need to be robustly assessed and the results clearly communicated. This requires the continuing development of methodologies to assess the reliability of event attribution results and further work to understand the potential utility of event attribution for stakeholder groups and decision makers.

	Abstract = {Weather and climate models struggle to represent lower tropospheric temperature and moisture profiles and surface fluxes in Arctic winter, partly because they lack or misrepresent physical processes that are specific to high latitudes. Observations have revealed two preferred states of the Arctic winter boundary layer. In the cloudy state, cloud liquid water limits surface radiative cooling, and temperature inversions are weak and elevated. In the radiatively clear state, strong surface radiative cooling leads to the build-up of surface-based temperature inversions. Many large-scale models lack the cloudy state, and some substantially underestimate inversion strength in the clear state. Here, the transformation from a moist to a cold dry air mass is modeled using an idealized Lagrangian perspective. The trajectory includes both boundary layer states, and the single-column experiment is the first Lagrangian Arctic air formation experiment (Larcform 1) organized within GEWEX GASS (Global atmospheric system studies). The intercomparison reproduces the typical biases of large-scale models: some models lack the cloudy state of the boundary layer due to the representation of mixed-phase microphysics or to the interaction between micro- and macrophysics. In some models, high emissivities of ice clouds or the lack of an insulating snow layer prevent the build-up of surface-based inversions in the radiatively clear state. Models substantially disagree on the amount of cloud liquid water in the cloudy state and on turbulent heat fluxes under clear skies. Observations of air mass transformations including both boundary layer states would allow for a tighter constraint of model behavior.},

	Abstract = { Abstract The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) provides a calibration-based sequential scheme for combining precipitation estimates from multiple satellites, as well as gauge analyses where feasible, at fine scales (0.25$\,^{\circ}$ × 0.25$\,^{\circ}$ and 3 hourly). TMPA is available both after and in real time, based on calibration by the TRMM Combined Instrument and TRMM Microwave Imager precipitation products, respectively. Only the after-real-time product incorporates gauge data at the present. The dataset covers the latitude band 50$\,^{\circ}$N--S for the period from 1998 to the delayed present. Early validation results are as follows: the TMPA provides reasonable performance at monthly scales, although it is shown to have precipitation rate--dependent low bias due to lack of sensitivity to low precipitation rates over ocean in one of the input products [based on Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B)]. At finer scales the TMPA is successful at approximately reproducing the surface observation--based histogram of precipitation, as well as reasonably detecting large daily events. The TMPA, however, has lower skill in correctly specifying moderate and light event amounts on short time intervals, in common with other finescale estimators. Examples are provided of a flood event and diurnal cycle determination. },

	Abstract = {The usefulness of previous Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) exercises has been hampered by a lack of radiative forcing information. This has made it difficult to understand reasons for differences between model responses. Effective radiative forcing (ERF) is easier to diagnose than traditional radiative forcing in global climate models (GCMs) and is more representative of the eventual temperature response. Here we examine the different methods of computing ERF in two GCMs. We find that ERF computed from a fixed sea surface temperature (SST) method (ERF_fSST) has much more certainty than regression based methods. Thirty year integrations are sufficient to reduce the 5--95% confidence interval in global ERF_fSST to 0.1 W m−2. For 2xCO2 ERF, 30 year integrations are needed to ensure that the signal is larger than the local confidence interval over more than 90% of the globe. Within the ERF_fSST method there are various options for prescribing SSTs and sea ice. We explore these and find that ERF is only weakly dependent on the methodological choices. Prescribing the monthly averaged seasonally varying model's preindustrial climatology is recommended for its smaller random error and easier implementation. As part of CMIP6, the Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) asks models to conduct 30 year ERF_fSST experiments using the model's own preindustrial climatology of SST and sea ice. The Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) will also mainly use this approach. We propose this as a standard method for diagnosing ERF and recommend that it be used across the climate modeling community to aid future comparisons.},

@article{Voigt:2017,
	Abstract = {Previous modeling work showed that aerosol can affect the position of the tropical rain belt, i.e., the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Yet, it remains unclear which aspects of the aerosol impact are robust across models, and which are not. Here, we present simulations with seven comprehensive atmosphere models that study the fast and slow impacts of an idealized anthropogenic aerosol on the zonal-mean ITCZ position. The fast impact, which results from aerosol atmospheric heating and land cooling before sea-surface temperature (SST) have time to respond, causes a northward ITCZ shift. Yet, the fast impact is compensated locally by decreased evaporation over the ocean, and a clear northward shift is only found for an unrealistically large aerosol forcing. The local compensation implies that while models differ in atmospheric aerosol heating, this does not contribute to model differences in the ITCZ shift. The slow impact includes the aerosol impact on the ocean surface energy balance and is mediated by SST changes. The slow impact is an order of magnitude more effective than the fast impact and causes a clear southward ITCZ shift for realistic aerosol forcing. Models agree well on the slow ITCZ shift when perturbed with the same SST pattern. However, an energetic analysis suggests that the slow ITCZ shifts would be substantially more model dependent in interactive-SST setups due to model differences in clear-sky radiative transfer and clouds. We also discuss implications for the representation of aerosol in climate models and attributions of recent observed ITCZ shifts to aerosol. This article is protected by copyright.

	Abstract = { Abstract The climate sensitivity of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) is described in terms of the equilibrium change in surface temperature due to a doubling of carbon dioxide in a slab ocean version of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) and the transient climate response, which is the surface temperature change at the point of doubling of carbon dioxide in a 1\% yr−1 CO2 simulation with the fully coupled CCSM. For a fixed atmospheric horizontal resolution across model versions, we show that the equilibrium sensitivity has monotonically increased across CSM1.4, CCSM2, to CCSM3 from 2.01$\,^{\circ}$ to 2.27$\,^{\circ}$ to 2.47$\,^{\circ}$C, respectively. The transient climate response for these versions is 1.44$\,^{\circ}$ to 1.09$\,^{\circ}$ to 1.48$\,^{\circ}$C, respectively. Using climate feedback analysis, it is shown that both clear-sky and cloudy-sky processes have contributed to the changes in transient climate response. The dependence of these sensitivities on horizontal resolution is also explored. The equilibrium sensitivity of the high-resolution (T85) version of CCSM3 is 2.71$\,^{\circ}$C, while the equilibrium response for the low-resolution model (T31) is 2.32$\,^{\circ}$C. It is shown that the shortwave cloud response of the high-resolution version of the CCSM3 is anomalous compared to the low- and moderate-resolution versions. },

	Abstract = {The transient responses of two versions of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) coupled climate model to a climate change forcing scenario are examined. The same computer codes were used to construct the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land surface components of the two models, and they employ the same types of sub-grid-scale parameterization schemes. The two model versions differ primarily, but not solely, in their spatial resolution. Comparisons are made of results from six coarse-resolution \{R15\} climate change experiments and three medium-resolution \{R30\} experiments in which levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and sulfate aerosols are specified to change over time. The two model versions yield similar global mean surface air temperature responses until the second half of the 21st century, after which the \{R15\} model exhibits a somewhat larger response. Polar amplification of the Northern Hemisphere's warming signal is more pronounced in the \{R15\} model, in part due to the R15's cooler control climate, which allows for larger snow and ice albedo positive feedbacks. Both models project a substantial weakening of the North Atlantic overturning circulation and a large reduction in the volume of Arctic sea ice to occur in the 21st century. Relative to their respective control integrations, there is a greater reduction of Arctic sea ice in the \{R15\} experiments than in the \{R30\} simulations as the climate system warms. The globally averaged annual mean precipitation rate is simulated to increase over time, with both model versions projecting an increase of about 8% to occur by the decade of the 2080s. While the global mean precipitation response is quite similar in the two models, regional differences exist, with the \{R30\} model displaying larger increases in equatorial regions. },

	Abstract = { AbstractAn aquaplanet model is used to study the nature of the highly persistent low-frequency waves that have been observed in models forced by zonally symmetric boundary conditions.Using the Hayashi spectral analysis of the extratropical waves, the authors find that a quasi-stationary wave 5 belongs to a wave packet obeying a well-defined dispersion relation with eastward group velocity. The components of the dispersion relation with k ≥ 5 baroclinically convert eddy available potential energy into eddy kinetic energy, whereas those with k < 5 are baroclinically neutral. In agreement with Green's model of baroclinic instability, wave 5 is weakly unstable, and the inverse energy cascade, which had been previously proposed as a main forcing for this type of wave, only acts as a positive feedback on its predominantly baroclinic energetics. The quasi-stationary wave is reinforced by a phase lock to an analogous pattern in the tropical convection, which provides further amplification to the wave. It is also found that the Pedlosky bounds on the phase speed of unstable waves provide guidance in explaining the latitudinal structure of the energy conversion, which is shown to be more enhanced where the zonal westerly surface wind is weaker. The wave's energy is then trapped in the waveguide created by the upper tropospheric jet stream. In agreement with Green's theory, as the equator-to-pole SST difference is reduced, the stationary marginally stable component shifts toward higher wavenumbers, while wave 5 becomes neutral and westward propagating.Some properties of the aquaplanet quasi-stationary waves are found to be in interesting agreement with a low frequency wave observed by Salby during December--February in the Southern Hemisphere so that this perspective on low frequency variability, apart from its value in terms of basic geophysical fluid dynamics, might be of specific interest for studying the earth's atmosphere. },

Decreasing ΔT results in slower zonal winds, a mean state with reduced meridional gradient of the 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), a smaller variance of Z500 anomalies, and a robust decrease in blocks and meridional amplitude of waves. Neglecting the decrease of variance associated with reduced ΔT would lead to the incorrect expectation that mean states with smaller Z500 gradients produce more blocks and higher wave amplitudes. Our results suggest further investigation of the hypothesis that reduced ΔT due to Arctic Amplification would increase blocking events and wave amplitude, hence leading to more midlatitude extreme weather events.},

	Abstract = {It is well established that forced planetary waves are critically important for blocking formation. To test whether blocking can be generated and maintained in the absence of topographic forcing, we carry out aqua-planet simulations using NCAR CAM2. Results show that blockings occur frequently under the aqua-planet conditions which have no forcing such as land-sea contrast, orography and stationary remote tropical forcing. Features of simulated blockings well resemble that in the real atmosphere, showing typical Ω-like patterns, persistence, and quasi-stationary behavior with occasionally westward shifting. It is found that the onset and maintenance of simulated blockings are due to interaction between quasi-stationary free Rossby waves and baroclinic eddies. For 10-year simulations, the blocking frequency is slightly higher than that in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) in the real atmosphere. These suggest that blocking is a natural consequence of rotating and baroclinic atmospheres, while locally topographic forcing and remote tropical forcing are not necessary conditions.},

	Abstract = {AbstractSatellite and reanalysis data are used to observe interannual variations in atmospheric diabatic heating and circulation within the ascending and descending branches of the Hadley circulation (HC) during the past 12 yr. The column-integrated divergence of dry static energy (DSE) and kinetic energy is inferred from satellite-based observations of atmospheric radiation, precipitation latent heating, and reanalysis-based surface sensible heat flux for monthly positions of the HC branches, determined from a mass weighted zonal mean meridional streamfunction analysis. Mean surface radiative fluxes inferred from satellite and surface measurements are consistent to 1 W m?2 (<1{\%}) over land and 4 W m?2 (2{\%}) over ocean. In the ascending branch, where precipitation latent heating dominates over radiative cooling, discrepancies in latent heating among different precipitation datasets reach 22 W m?2 (17{\%}), compared to 3?6 W m?2 in the descending branches.

	Abstract = {Abstract We explore the effects of seasonal variability for the climate of Earth-like planets as determined by the two parameters polar obliquity and orbital eccentricity using a general circulation model of intermediate complexity. In the first part of the paper we examine the consequences of different values of obliquity and eccentricity for the spatio-temporal patterns of radiation and surface temperatures as well as for the main characteristics of the atmospheric circulation. In the second part of the paper we analyse the associated implications for the habitability of planets close to the outer edge of the habitable zone (HZ). The second part focuses in particular on the multistability property of climate, i.e. the parallel existence of both an ice-free and an ice-covered climate state. Our results show that seasonal variability affects both the existence of and transitions between the two climate states. Moreover, our experiments reveal that planets with Earth-like atmospheres and high seasonal variability can have ice-free areas at much larger distance from the host star than planets without seasonal variability, which leads to a substantial expansion of the outer edge of the HZ. Sensitivity experiments exploring the role of azimuthal obliquity and surface heat capacity test the robustness of our results. On circular orbits, our findings obtained with a general circulation model agree well with previous studies based on one dimensional energy balance models, whereas significant differences are found on eccentric orbits. },

@article{Godolt:2015,
	Abstract = {Abstract The potential habitability of a terrestrial planet is usually defined by the possible existence of liquid water on its surface, since life as we know it needs liquid water at least during a part of its life cycle. The potential presence of liquid water on a planetary surface depends on many factors such as, most importantly, surface temperatures. The properties of the planetary atmosphere and its interaction with the radiative energy provided by the planet's host star are thereby of decisive importance. In this study we investigate the influence of different main-sequence stars (F, G, and K-type stars) upon the climate of Earth-like extrasolar planets and their potential habitability by applying a state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) Earth climate model accounting for local and dynamical processes. The calculations have been performed for planets with Earth-like atmospheres at orbital distances (and corresponding orbital periods) where the total amount of energy received from the various host stars equals the solar constant. In contrast to previous 3D modeling studies, we include the effect of ozone radiative heating upon the vertical temperature structure of the atmospheres. The global orbital mean results obtained have been compared to those of a one-dimensional (1D) radiative convective climate model to investigate the approximation of global mean 3D results by those of 1D models. The different stellar spectral energy distributions lead to different surface temperatures and due to ozone heating to very different vertical temperature structures. As previous 1D studies we find higher surface temperatures for the Earth-like planet around the K-type star, and lower temperatures for the planet around the F-type star compared to an Earth-like planet around the Sun. However, this effect is more pronounced in the 3D model results than in the 1D model because the 3D model accounts for feedback processes such as the ice-albedo and the water vapor feedback. Whether the 1D model may approximate the global mean of the 3D model results strongly depends on the choice of the relative humidity profile in the 1D model, which is used to determine the water vapor profile. Hence, possible changes in the hydrological cycle need to be accounted for when estimating the potential habitability of an extrasolar planet. },

	Abstract = {Distant planets in globally ice-covered, "snowball," states may depend on increases in their host stars' luminosity to become hospitable for surface life. Using a general circulation model, we simulated the equilibrium climate response of a planet to a range of instellations from an F-, G-, or M-dwarf star. The range of instellation that permits both complete ice cover and at least partially ice-free climate states is a measure of the climate hysteresis that a planet can exhibit. An ice-covered planet with high climate hysteresis would show a higher resistance to the initial loss of surface ice coverage with increases in instellation, and abrupt, extreme ice loss once deglaciation begins. Our simulations indicate that the climate hysteresis depends sensitively on the host star spectral energy distribution. Under fixed CO 2 conditions, a planet orbiting an M-dwarf star exhibits a smaller climate hysteresis, requiring smaller instellation to initiate deglaciation than planets orbiting hotter, brighter stars. This is due to the higher absorption of near-infrared radiation by ice on the surfaces and greenhouse gases and clouds in the atmosphere of an M-dwarf planet. Increases in atmospheric CO 2 further lower the climate hysteresis, as M-dwarf snowball planets exhibit a larger radiative response than G-dwarf snowball planets for the same increase in CO 2 . For a smaller hysteresis, planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone will thaw earlier in their evolutionary history, and will experience a less abrupt transition out of global ice cover.},

	Abstract = {The Kepler era of exoplanetary discovery has presented the astronomical community with a cornucopia of planetary systems that are very different from the one that we inhabit. It has long been known that Jupiter plays a major role in the orbital parameters of Mars and its climate, but there is also a long-standing belief that Jupiter would play a similar role for Earth if not for the Moon. Using a three-dimensional general circulation model (3D GCM) with a fully coupled ocean, we simulate what would happen to the climate of an Earth-like world if Mars did not exist, but a Jupiter-like planet was much closer to Earth's orbit. We investigate two scenarios that involve the evolution of the Earth-like planet's orbital eccentricity from 0 to 0.283 over 6500 years, and from 0 to 0.066 on a timescale of 4500 years. In both cases we discover that they would maintain relatively temperate climates over the timescales simulated. More Earth-like planets in multi-planet systems will be discovered as we continue to survey the skies and the results herein show that the proximity of large gas giant planets may play an important role in the habitability of these worlds. These are the first such 3D GCM simulations using a fully coupled ocean with a planetary orbit that evolves over time due to the presence of a giant planet.},

In this work, we present the first detailed study of the atmospheric effects of this irradiation pattern on known and hypothetical gaseous circumbinary planets. Using both a one-dimensional energy balance model (EBM) and a three-dimensional general circulation model (GCM), we look at the temperature differences between circumbinary planets and their equivalent single-star cases in order to determine the nature of the atmospheres of these planets. We find that for circumbinary planets on stable orbits around their host stars, temperature differences are on average no more than 1.0% in the most extreme cases. Based on detailed modeling with the GCM, we find that these temperature differences are not large enough to excite circulation differences between the two cases. We conclude that gaseous circumbinary planets can be treated as their equivalent single-star case in future atmospheric modeling efforts.},

	Abstract = {We present a new version of our code for modeling the atmospheric circulation on gaseous exoplanets, now employing a "double-gray" radiative transfer scheme, which self-consistently solves for fluxes and heating throughout the atmosphere, including the emerging (observable) infrared flux. We separate the radiation into infrared and optical components, each with its own absorption coefficient, and solve standard two-stream radiative transfer equations. We use a constant optical absorption coefficient, while the infrared coefficient can scale as a power law with pressure; however, for simplicity, the results shown in this paper use a constant infrared coefficient. Here we describe our new code in detail and demonstrate its utility by presenting a generic hot Jupiter model. We discuss issues related to modeling the deepest pressures of the atmosphere and describe our use of the diffusion approximation for radiative fluxes at high optical depths. In addition, we present new models using a simple form for magnetic drag on the atmosphere. We calculate emitted thermal phase curves and find that our drag-free model has the brightest region of the atmosphere offset by ~12$\,^{\circ}$ from the substellar point and a minimum flux that is 17\% of the maximum, while the model with the strongest magnetic drag has an offset of only ~2$\,^{\circ}$ and a ratio of 13\%. Finally, we calculate rates of numerical loss of kinetic energy at ~15\% for every model except for our strong-drag model, where there is no measurable loss; we speculate that this is due to the much decreased wind speeds in that model.},

	Abstract = { AbstractThe response of the monsoonal and annual-mean Hadley circulation to orbital precession is examined in an idealized atmospheric general circulation model with an aquaplanet slab-ocean lower boundary. Contrary to expectations, the simulated monsoonal Hadley circulation is weaker when perihelion occurs at the summer solstice than when aphelion occurs at the summer solstice. The angular momentum balance and energy balance are examined to understand the mechanisms that produce this result. That the summer with stronger insolation has a weaker circulation is the result of an increase in the atmosphere's energetic stratification, the gross moist stability, which increases more than the amount required to balance the change in atmospheric energy flux divergence necessitated by the change in top-of-atmosphere net radiation. The solstice-season changes result in annual-mean Hadley circulation changes (e.g., changes in circulation strength). },

	Abstract = {Organized convection in the tropics occurs across a range of spatial and temporal scales and strongly influences cloud cover and humidity. One mode of organization found is ``self-aggregation,'' in which moist convection spontaneously organizes into one or several isolated clusters despite spatially homogeneous boundary conditions and forcing. Self-aggregation is driven by interactions between clouds, moisture, radiation, surface fluxes, and circulation, and occurs in a wide variety of idealized simulations of radiative--convective equilibrium. Here we provide a review of convective self-aggregation in numerical simulations, including its character, causes, and effects. We describe the evolution of self-aggregation including its time and length scales and the physical mechanisms leading to its triggering and maintenance, and we also discuss possible links to climate and climate change.},

@article{Covey:2016,
	Abstract = { AbstractMetrics are proposed---that is, a few summary statistics that condense large amounts of data from observations or model simulations---encapsulating the diurnal cycle of precipitation. Vector area averaging of Fourier amplitude and phase produces useful information in a reasonably small number of harmonic dial plots, a procedure familiar from atmospheric tide research. The metrics cover most of the globe but down-weight high-latitude wintertime ocean areas where baroclinic waves are most prominent. This enables intercomparison of a large number of climate models with observations and with each other. The diurnal cycle of precipitation has features not encountered in typical climate model intercomparisons, notably the absence of meaningful ``average model'' results that can be displayed in a single two-dimensional map. Displaying one map per model guides development of the metrics proposed here by making it clear that land and ocean areas must be averaged separately, but interpreting maps from all models becomes problematic as the size of a multimodel ensemble increases.Global diurnal metrics provide quick comparisons with observations and among models, using the most recent version of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). This includes, for the first time in CMIP, spatial resolutions comparable to global satellite observations. Consistent with earlier studies of resolution versus parameterization of the diurnal cycle, the longstanding tendency of models to produce rainfall too early in the day persists in the high-resolution simulations, as expected if the error is due to subgrid-scale physics. },

@article{Yang:2014,
	Abstract = {One of the crucial features of tropical convection is the observed variability on multiple spatiotemporal scales, ranging from cumulus clouds on the daily time scale over a few kilometers to intraseasonal oscillations over planetary scales. The diurnal cycle of tropical convection is a significant process, but its large-scale impact is not well understood. Here, we develop a multi-scale analytic model to assess the intraseasonal impact of planetary-scale inertial oscillations in the diurnal cycle. A self-contained derivation of a multi-scale model governing planetary-scale tropical flows on the daily and intraseasonal time scale is provided below, by following the derivation of systematic multi-scale models for tropical convection. This derivation demonstrates the analytic tractability of the model. The appeal of the multi-scale model developed here is that it provides assessment of eddy flux divergences of momentum and temperature and their intraseasonal impact on the planetary-scale circulation in a transparent fashion. Here, we use it to study the intraseasonal impact of a model for the diurnal cycle heating with two local phase-lagged baroclinic modes with the congestus, deep, stratiform life cycle. The results show that during boreal summer, the eddy flux divergence of temperature dominates in the northern hemisphere, providing significant heating in the middle troposphere of the northern hemisphere with large-scale ascent and cooling with subsidence surrounding this heating center. Due to the analytic tractability of the model, such significant eddy flux divergence of temperature is traced to meridional asymmetry of the diurnal cycle heating. In an ideal zonally symmetric case, the resulting planetary-scale circulation on the intraseasonal time scale during boreal summer is characterized by ascent in the northern hemisphere, southward motion in the upper troposphere, descent around the equator and northward motion in the lower troposphere. The intraseasonal impact of the diurnal cycle on the planetary scale also includes negative potential temperature anomalies in the lower troposphere, which suggests convective triggering in the tropics. Furthermore, a fully coupled model for the intraseasonal impact of the diurnal cycle on the Hadley cell shows that the overturning motion induced by the eddy flux divergences of momentum and temperature from the diurnal cycle can strengthen the upper branch of the winter cell of the Hadley circulation, but weaken the lower branch of the winter cell. The corresponding eddy fluxes from the diurnal cycle are very weak for the equinox case with symmetric meridional profiles, and eddy momentum fluxes are small for all scenarios considered here.},

@article{Cullum:2014,
	Abstract = {The climate and, hence, potential habitability of a planet crucially depends on how its atmospheric and ocean circulation transports heat from warmer to cooler regions. However, previous studies of planetary climate have concentrated on modeling the dynamics of atmospheres, while dramatically simplifying the treatment of oceans, which neglects or misrepresents the effect of the ocean in the total heat transport. Even the majority of studies with a dynamic ocean have used a simple so-called aquaplanet that has no continental barriers, which is a configuration that dramatically changes the ocean dynamics. Here, the significance of the response of poleward ocean heat transport to planetary rotation period is shown with a simple meridional barrier--the simplest representation of any continental configuration. The poleward ocean heat transport increases significantly as the planetary rotation period is increased. The peak heat transport more than doubles when the rotation period is increased by a factor of ten. There are also significant changes to ocean temperature at depth, with implications for the carbon cycle. There is strong agreement between the model results and a scale analysis of the governing equations. This result highlights the importance of both planetary rotation period and the ocean circulation when considering planetary habitability.},

@article{Lawrence:2005,
	Abstract = { Abstract The relative humidity (RH) and the dewpoint temperature (td) are two widely used indicators of the amount of moisture in air. The exact conversion from RH to td, as well as highly accurate approximations, are too complex to be done easily without the help of a calculator or computer. However, there is a very simple rule of thumb that can be very useful for approximating the conversion for moist air (RH > 50\%), which does not appear to be widely known by the meteorological community: td decreases by about 1$\,^{\circ}$C for every 5\% decrease in RH (starting at td = t, the dry bulb temperature, when RH = 100\%). This article examines the mathematical basis and accuracy of this and other relationships between the dewpoint and relative humidity. Several useful applications of the simple conversion are presented, in particular the computation of the cumulus cloud-base level (or lifting condensation level) as zLCL ≈ (20 + t/5) (100 − RH), where zLCL is in meters when t is in degrees Celcius and RH in percent. Finally, a historical perspective is given with anecdotes about some of the early work in this field. },

@article{Zuidema:2016,
	Abstract = { AbstractWell-known problems trouble coupled general circulation models of the eastern Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins. Model climates are significantly more symmetric about the equator than is observed. Model sea surface temperatures are biased warm south and southeast of the equator, and the atmosphere is too rainy within a band south of the equator. Near-coastal eastern equatorial SSTs are too warm, producing a zonal SST gradient in the Atlantic opposite in sign to that observed. The U.S. Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR) Eastern Tropical Ocean Synthesis Working Group (WG) has pursued an updated assessment of coupled model SST biases, focusing on the surface energy balance components, on regional error sources from clouds, deep convection, winds, and ocean eddies; on the sensitivity to model resolution; and on remote impacts. Motivated by the assessment, the WG makes the following recommendations: 1) encourage identification of the specific parameterizations contributing to the biases in individual models, as these can be model dependent; 2) restrict multimodel intercomparisons to specific processes; 3) encourage development of high-resolution coupled models with a concurrent emphasis on parameterization development of finer-scale ocean and atmosphere features, including low clouds; 4) encourage further availability of all surface flux components from buoys, for longer continuous time periods, in persistently cloudy regions; and 5) focus on the eastern basin coastal oceanic upwelling regions, where further opportunities for observational--modeling synergism exist. },

@article{Gettelman:2016,
	Abstract = { AbstractAerosols can influence cloud radiative effects and, thus, may alter interpretation of how Earth's radiative budget responds to climate forcing. Three different ensemble experiments from the same climate model with different greenhouse gas and aerosol scenarios are used to analyze the role of aerosols in climate feedbacks and their spread across initial condition ensembles of transient climate simulations. The standard deviation of global feedback parameters across ensemble members is low, typically 0.02 W m−2 K−1. Feedbacks from high (8.5 W m−2) and moderate (4.5 W m−2) year 2100 forcing cases are nearly identical. An aerosol kernel is introduced to remove effects of aerosol cloud interactions that alias into cloud feedbacks. Adjusted cloud feedbacks indicate an ``aerosol feedback'' resulting from changes to climate that increase sea-salt emissions, mostly in the Southern Ocean. Ensemble simulations also indicate higher tropical cloud feedbacks with higher aerosol loading. These effects contribute to a difference in cloud feedbacks of nearly 50\% between ensembles of the same model. These two effects are also seen in aquaplanet simulations with varying fixed drop number. Thus aerosols can be a significant modifier of cloud feedbacks, and different representations of aerosols and their interactions with clouds may contribute to multimodel spread in climate feedbacks and climate sensitivity in multimodel archives. },

@article{Grise:2016,
	Abstract = { AbstractThis study examines the dynamical mechanisms responsible for changes in midlatitude clouds and cloud radiative effects (CRE) that occur in conjunction with meridional shifts in the jet streams over the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Oceans. When the midlatitude jet shifts poleward, extratropical cyclones and their associated upward vertical velocity anomalies closely follow. As a result, a poleward jet shift contributes to a poleward shift in high-topped storm-track clouds and their associated longwave CRE. However, when the jet shifts poleward, downward vertical velocity anomalies increase equatorward of the jet, contributing to an enhancement of the boundary layer estimated inversion strength (EIS) and an increase in low cloud amount there. Because shortwave CRE depends on the reflection of solar radiation by clouds in all layers, the shortwave cooling effects of midlatitude clouds increase with both upward vertical velocity anomalies and positive EIS anomalies. Over midlatitude oceans where a poleward jet shift contributes to positive EIS anomalies but downward vertical velocity anomalies, the two effects cancel, and net observed changes in shortwave CRE are small.Global climate models generally capture the observed anomalies associated with midlatitude jet shifts. However, there is large intermodel spread in the shortwave CRE anomalies, with a subset of models showing a large shortwave cloud radiative warming over midlatitude oceans with a poleward jet shift. In these models, midlatitude shortwave CRE is sensitive to vertical velocity perturbations, but the observed sensitivity to EIS perturbations is underestimated. Consequently, these models might incorrectly estimate future midlatitude cloud feedbacks in regions where appreciable changes in both vertical velocity and EIS are projected. },

	Abstract = { AbstractWhen climate is forced by a doubling of CO2, a number of feedback processes are induced, such as changes of water vapor, clouds, and surface albedo. Here the CO2 forcing and concomitant feedbacks are studied individually using a general circulation model coupled to an aquaplanet mixed layer ocean. A technique for fixing the radiative effects of moisture and clouds by reusing these variables from 1 × CO2 and 2 × CO2 equilibrium climates in the model's radiation code allows for a detailed decomposition of forcings, feedbacks, and responses. The cloud feedback in this model is found to have a weak global average effect and surface albedo feedbacks have been eliminated. As in previous studies, the water vapor feedback is found to approximately double climate sensitivity, but while its radiative effect is strongly amplified at low latitudes, the resulting response displays about the same degree of polar amplification as the full all-feedbacks experiment. In fact, atmospheric energy transports are found to change in a way that yields the same meridional pattern of response as when the water vapor feedback is turned off. The authors conclude that while the water vapor feedback does not in itself lead to polar amplification by increasing the ratio of high- to low-latitude warming, it does double climate sensitivity both at low and high latitudes. A polar amplification induced by other feedbacks in the system, such as the Planck and lapse rate feedbacks here, is thus strengthened in the sense of increasing the difference in high- and low-latitude warming. },

	Abstract = { Abstract Recent coordinated efforts, in which numerous general circulation climate models have been run for a common set of experiments, have produced large datasets of projections of future climate for various scenarios. Those multimodel ensembles sample initial conditions, parameters, and structural uncertainties in the model design, and they have prompted a variety of approaches to quantifying uncertainty in future climate change. International climate change assessments also rely heavily on these models. These assessments often provide equal-weighted averages as best-guess results, assuming that individual model biases will at least partly cancel and that a model average prediction is more likely to be correct than a prediction from a single model based on the result that a multimodel average of present-day climate generally outperforms any individual model. This study outlines the motivation for using multimodel ensembles and discusses various challenges in interpreting them. Among these challenges are that the number of models in these ensembles is usually small, their distribution in the model or parameter space is unclear, and that extreme behavior is often not sampled. Model skill in simulating present-day climate conditions is shown to relate only weakly to the magnitude of predicted change. It is thus unclear by how much the confidence in future projections should increase based on improvements in simulating present-day conditions, a reduction of intermodel spread, or a larger number of models. Averaging model output may further lead to a loss of signal---for example, for precipitation change where the predicted changes are spatially heterogeneous, such that the true expected change is very likely to be larger than suggested by a model average. Last, there is little agreement on metrics to separate ``good'' and ``bad'' models, and there is concern that model development, evaluation, and posterior weighting or ranking are all using the same datasets. While the multimodel average appears to still be useful in some situations, these results show that more quantitative methods to evaluate model performance are critical to maximize the value of climate change projections from global models. },

	Abstract = {The increase in the vigor of the hydrological cycle simulated in a 2 {\texttimes} CO2 experiment with the Canadian Climate Centre general circulation model is smaller than that obtained by other models which have similar increases in mean surface temperature. The surface energy budget, which encompasses also the moisture budget for the oceans, is analyzed. Changes in the net radiative input to and sensible heat flux from the surface act to warm it. This is balanced, at the new equilibrium, by a change in the latent heat flux which acts to cool it. Although this same general behavior is seen in other models, the increase in radiative input to the surface in the CCC GCM is smaller than in other models while the change in the sensible heat flux is of similar size. As a consequence, the latent heat flux required for balance is smaller. The comparatively small increase in the net radiative input at the surface occurs because of a decrease in the solar component. On average the decrease in solar input in the tropical region outweighs the higher latitude increase associated with the snow/ice albedo feedback. The notable tropical decrease in solar input occurs because the albedo of the clouds increase enough in this region to outweigh a small decrease in cloud amount. The increase in cloud albedo in the warmer and moister tropical atmosphere is a consequence of the parameterized cloud optical properties in the model which play an important role in the regulation of the surface energy and moisture budgets. The results demonstrate some of the consequences of the negative feedback mechanism associated with increasing cloud albedo in the model. They also suggest that the simulated change in the vigor of the hydrological cycle is not a simple function of the average increase in surface temperature but is a consequence of all of the processes in the model which control the available energy at the surface as a function of latitude.},

@article{Gudgel:2001,
	Abstract = { Abstract The sensitivity of a coupled general circulation model (CGCM) to tropical marine stratocumulus (MSc) clouds and low-level clouds over the tropical land is examined. The hypothesis that low-level clouds play an important role in determining the strength and position of the Walker circulation and also on the strength and phase of the El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is studied using a Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) experimental prediction CGCM. In the Tropics, a GFDL experimental prediction CGCM exhibits a strong bias in the western Pacific where an eastward shift in the ascending branch of the Walker circulation diminishes the strength and expanse of the sea surface temperature (SST) warm pool, thereby reducing the east--west SST gradient, and effectively weakening the trade winds. These model features are evidence of a poorly simulated Walker circulation, one that mirrors a ``perpetual El Ni{\~n}o'' state. One possible factor contributing to this bias is a poor simulation of MSc clouds in the eastern equatorial Pacific (which are essential to a proper SST annual cycle). Another possible contributing factor might be radiative heating biases over the land in the Tropics, which could, in turn, have a significant impact on the preferred locations of maximum convection in the Tropics. As a means of studying the sensitivity of a CGCM to both MSc clouds and to varied radiative forcing over the land in the Tropics, low-level clouds obtained from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) are prescribed. The experiment sets consist of one where clouds are fully predicted, another where ISCCP low-level clouds are prescribed over the oceans alone, and a third where ISCCP low-level clouds are prescribed both over the global oceans and over the tropical landmasses. A set of ten 12-month hindcasts is performed for each experiment. The results show that the combined prescription of interannually varying global ocean and climatological tropical land low-level clouds into the CGCM results in a much improved simulation of the Walker circulation over the Pacific Ocean. The improvement to the tropical circulation was also notable over the Indian and Atlantic basins as well. These improvements in circulation led to a considerable increase in ENSO hindcast skill in the first year by the CGCM. These enhancements were a function of both the presence of MSc clouds over the tropical oceans and were also due to the more realistic positioning of the regions of maximum convection in the Tropics. This latter model feature was essentially a response to the change in radiative forcing over tropical landmasses associated with a reduction in low cloud fraction and optical depth when ISCCP low-level clouds were prescribed there. These results not only underscore the importance of a reasonable representation of MSc clouds but also point out the considerable impact that radiative forcing over the tropical landmasses has on the simulated position of the Walker circulation and also on ENSO forecasting. },

	Abstract = { AbstractBecause sea ice thickness is known to influence future patterns of sea ice concentration, it is likely that an improved initialization of sea ice thickness in a coupled ocean--atmosphere model would improve Arctic sea ice cover forecasts. Here, two sea ice thickness datasets as possible candidates for forecast initialization were investigated: the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS). Using Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data, it was shown that the PIOMAS dataset had a more realistic representation of sea ice thickness than CFSR. Subsequently, both March CFSR and PIOMAS sea ice thicknesses were used to initialize hindcasts using the Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), model. A second set of model runs was also done in which the original model physics were modified to more physically reasonable settings---namely, increasing the number of marine stratus clouds in the Arctic region and enabling realistic representation of the ice--ocean heat flux. Hindcasts were evaluated using sea ice concentration observations from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Team and Bootstrap algorithms. Results show that using PIOMAS initial sea ice thickness in addition to the physics modifications yielded significant improvement in the prediction of September Arctic sea ice extent along with increased interannual predictive skill. Significant local improvements in sea ice concentration were also seen in distinct regions for the change to PIOMAS initial thickness or the physics adjustments, with the most improvement occurring when these changes were applied concurrently. },

These comprise the ability to simulate biogeochemical cycles, including those of carbon and nitrogen, a variety of atmospheric chemistry options, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and an atmosphere that extends to the lower thermosphere. These and other new model capabilities are enabling investigations into a wide range of pressing scientific questions, providing new foresight into possible future climates and increasing our collective knowledge about the behavior and interactions of the Earth system. Simulations with numerous configurations of the CESM have been provided to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and are being analyzed by the broad community of scientists. Additionally, the model source code and associated documentation are freely available to the scientific community to use for Earth system studies, making it a true community tool.

@article{Rieck:2012,
	Abstract = { AbstractThe mechanisms that govern the response of shallow cumulus, such as found in the trade wind regions, to a warming of the atmosphere in which large-scale atmospheric processes act to keep relative humidity constant are explored. Two robust effects are identified. First, and as is well known, the liquid water lapse rate increases with temperature and tends to increase the amount of water in clouds, making clouds more reflective of solar radiation. Second, and less well appreciated, the surface fluxes increase with the saturation specific humidity, which itself is a strong function of temperature. Using large-eddy simulations it is shown that the liquid water lapse rate acts as a negative feedback: a positive temperature increase driven by radiative forcing is reduced by the increase in cloud water and hence cloud albedo. However, this effect is more than compensated by a reduction of cloudiness associated with the deepening and relative drying of the boundary layer, driven by larger surface moisture fluxes. Because they are so robust, these effects are thought to underlie changes in the structure of the marine boundary layer as a result of global warming. },

	Abstract = { Abstract Quantitative estimates of precipitation in a typical undisturbed trade wind region are derived from 2 months of radar reflectivity data and compared to the meteorological environment determined from soundings, surface flux, and airborne-lidar data. Shallow precipitation was ubiquitous, covering on average about 2\% of the region and contributing to at least half of the total precipitation. Echo fractions on the scale of the radar domain range between 0\% and 10\% and vary greatly within a period from a few hours to a day. Variability in precipitation relates most strongly to variability in humidity and the zonal wind speed, although greater inversion heights and deeper clouds are also evident at times of more rain. The analysis herein suggests that subtle fluctuations in both the strength of the easterlies and in subsidence play a major role in regulating humidity and hence precipitation, even within a given meteorological regime (here, the undisturbed trades). },

	Abstract = { Abstract A simplified cumulus parameterization scheme, suitable for use in GCMs, is presented. This parameterization is based on a plume ensemble concept similar to that originally proposed by Arakawa and Schubert (1974). However, it employs three assumptions which significantly simplify the formulation and implementation of the scheme. It is assumed that an ensemble of convective‐scale updrafts with associated saturated downdrafts may exist when the atmosphere is locally conditionally unstable in the lower troposphere. However, the updraft ensemble is comprised only of those plumes which are sufficiently buoyant to penetrate through this unstable layer. It is assumed that all such plumes have the same upward mass flux at the base of the convective layer. The third assumption is that moist convection, which occurs only when there is convective available potential energy (CAPE) for reversible ascent of an undiluted parcel from the sub‐cloud layer, acts to remove CAPE at an exponential rate with a specified adjustment time scale. The performance of the scheme and its sensitivity to choices of disposable parameters is illustrated by presenting results from a series of idealized single‐column model tests. These tests demonstrate that the scheme permits establishment of a quasi‐equilibrium between large‐scale forcing and convective response. However, it is also shown that the strength of convective downdrafts is an important factor in determining the nature of the equilibrium state. Relatively strong down‐drafts give rise to an unsteady irregularly fluctuating state characterized by alternate periods of deep and shallow convection. The effect of using the scheme for GCM climate simulations is illustrated by presenting selected results of a multi‐year simulation carried out with the Canadian Climate Centre GCM using the new parameterization (the CONV simulation). Comparison of these results with those for a climate simulation made with the standard model (the CONTROL simulation, as documented by McFarlane et al., 1992) reveals the importance of other parameterized processes in determining the ultimate effect of introducing the new convective scheme. The radiative response to changes in the cloudiness regime is particularly important in this regard. },

	Abstract = { Abstract The impact of physical parameterizations on simulations of cloud-topped marine boundary layers is investigated using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University--NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5). Three-month MM5 simulations of the northeast and southeast Pacific during June--August 1987 are boundary forced with time- varying ECMWF analyses. Runs with four planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations already implemented in MM5 are compared with runs using new parameterizations of boundary layer turbulence and shallow cumulus convection (ShCu) described in a companion paper. Numerous modifications to the MM5 that allow it to be used as a regional climate model are described. The simulated 3-month mean shortwave cloud radiative forcing (SWCF) and vertical structure of cloud-topped boundary layers in the northeast Pacific are sensitive to the PBL/shallow convection schemes. All four current MM5 PBL schemes [the Blackadar, Medium-Range Forecast (MRF), Burk--Thompson, and Gayno--Seaman schemes] produce overly shallow boundary layers with excessive SWCF throughout this region, especially in the transition from stratocumulus to trade cumulus where their SWCF errors range from 130 (Gayno--Seaman) to 200 W m−2 (MRF). These errors likely reflect inadequate vertical mixing by parameterized turbulence and shallow convection. The only shallow convection scheme available for MM5, the Grell scheme, was almost totally inactive in this region, so no shallow convection scheme was used for the above simulations. The Grenier-- Bretherton (GB01) scheme, which entrains more aggressively above stratocumulus-capped convective layers, has much better regional SWCF and vertical structure. Without shallow cumulus convection, the scheme still produces excessive cloud in the transition regions; the main impact of the ShCu parameterization is to remove this bias. With all schemes, the near-surface air has a cool, dry bias, and surface turbulent fluxes are somewhat larger than observed. Sensitivity studies show that the SWCF is sensitive to a halving of the cloud droplet concentration, to plausible uncertainties in parameterized penetrative mixing at cumulus cloud tops and in stratocumulus entrainment, and (in the coastal zone) to horizontal resolution. Southeast Pacific simulations show that the GB01+ShCu scheme can also accurately represent another subtropical boundary layer cloud regime. },

	Abstract = { Abstract Subtropical shallow cumulus convection is shown to play an important role in tropical climate dynamics, in which convective mixing between the atmospheric boundary layer and the free troposphere initiates a chain of large-scale feedbacks. It is found that the presence of shallow convection in the subtropics helps set the width and intensity of oceanic ITCZs, a mechanism here termed the shallow cumulus humidity throttle because of the control exerted on the moisture supply to the deep convection zones. These conclusions are reached after investigations based on a tropical climate model of intermediate complexity, with sufficient vertical degrees of freedom to capture (i) the effects of shallow convection on the boundary layer moisture budget and (ii) the dependency of deep convection on the free-tropospheric humidity. An explicit shallow cumulus mixing time scale in this simple parameterization is varied to assess sensitivity, with moist static energy budget analysis aiding to identify how the local effect of shallow convection is balanced globally. A reduction in the mixing efficiency of shallow convection leads to a more humid atmospheric mixed layer, and less surface evaporation, with a drier free troposphere outside of the convecting zones. Advection of drier free-tropospheric air from the subtropics by transients such as dry intrusions, as well as by mean inflow, causes a substantial narrowing of the convection zones by inhibition of deep convection at their margins. In the tropical mean, the reduction of convection by this narrowing more than compensates for the reduction in surface evaporation. Balance is established via a substantial decrease in tropospheric temperatures throughout the Tropics, associated with the reduction in convective heating. The temperature response---and associated radiative contribution to the net flux into the column---have broad spatial scales, while the reduction of surface evaporation is concentrated outside of the convecting zones. This results in differential net flux across the convecting zone, in a sense that acts to destabilize those areas that do convect. This results in stronger large-scale convergence and more intense convection within a narrower area. Finally, mixed layer ocean experiments show that in a coupled ocean--atmosphere system this indirect feedback mechanism can lead to SST differences up to +2 K between cases with different shallow cumulus mixing time, tending to counteract the direct radiative impact of low subtropical clouds on SST. },

@article{Johnson:1999,
	Abstract = { Abstract It has long been known that trade wind cumulus and deep cumulonimbus represent primary components of the broad spectrum of cumulus clouds in the Tropics, which has led to the concept of a bimodal distribution of tropical clouds. However, recent analyses of shipboard radar data from Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean--Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) provide evidence of abundant populations of a third cloud type, cumulus congestus. Congestus clouds constitute over half the precipitating convective clouds in COARE and contribute over one-quarter of the total convective rainfall. Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment studies reveal a similar midlevel peak in the distribution of radar-echo tops. These findings lead to the conclusion that shallow cumulus, congestus, and cumulonimbus are all prominent tropical cumulus cloud types. They are associated with trimodal distributions of divergence, cloud detrainment, and fractional cloudiness in the Tropics. The peaks in the distributions of radar-echo tops for these three cloud types are in close proximity to prominent stable layers that exist over the Pacific warm pool and the tropical eastern Atlantic: near 2 km (the trade stable layer), ∼5 km (near 0$\,^{\circ}$C), and ∼15--16 km (the tropopause). These stable layers are inferred to inhibit cloud growth and promote cloud detrainment. The 0$\,^{\circ}$C stable layer can produce detrainment from cumulonimbi (attendant shelf clouds) and help retard the growth of precipitation-laden and strongly entraining congestus clouds. Moreover, restriction of growth of congestus clouds to just above the 0$\,^{\circ}$C level limits further enhancement of cloud buoyancy through glaciation. The three cloud types are found to vary significantly during COARE on the timescale of the 30--60-day intraseasonal oscillation. The specific roles of clouds of the congestus variety in the general circulation are not yet clear, but some (the shallower ones) contribute to moistening and preconditioning the atmosphere for deep convection; others (the deeper ones) contribute an important fraction of the total tropical rainfall, and both likely produce many midlevel clouds, thereby modulating the radiative heating of the tropical atmosphere. },

@article{Bretherton:2004b,
	Abstract = { Abstract A new parameterization of shallow cumulus convection is presented. The parameterization consists of a mass flux scheme based on a buoyancy-sorting, entrainment--detrainment plume model. The mass flux scheme is coupled to a 1.5-order turbulence closure model with an entrainment closure for convective boundary layers. Model performance is verified using single-column-model simulations at relatively high vertical resolution of pure trade-cumulus convection and a cumulus to stratocumulus transition. Mixing rates, cloud cover, and vertical flux profiles, as deduced from previously published large-eddy simulation studies, are well reproduced by the parameterization. The model is used to demonstrate that height variations of lateral mixing rates can be successfully captured by a simple implementation of a buoyancy-sorting mechanism in the updraft cloud model. A companion paper describes the implementation of the scheme in a mesoscale model. },

@article{Persson:2012,
	Abstract = {Various measurements from the Surface Heat Flux of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment have been combined to study structures and processes producing the onset and end of summer melt over Arctic sea ice. The analysis links the surface energy budget to free-troposphere synoptic variables, clouds, precipitation, and in-ice temperatures. The key results are (1) SHEBA melt-season transitions are associated with atmospheric synoptic events (2) onset of melt clearly occurs on May 28, while the end of melt is produced by a sequence of three atmospheric storm events over a 28-day period producing step-like reductions in the net surface energy flux. The last one occurs on August 22.; (3) melt onset is primarily due to large increases in the downwelling longwave radiation and modest decreases in the surface albedo; (4) decreases in the downwelling longwave radiation occur for all end-of-melt transition steps, while increases in surface albedo occur for the first two; (5) decreases in downwelling shortwave radiation contribute only to the first end-of-melt transition step; (6) springtime free-tropospheric warming preconditions the atmosphere--ice system for the subsequent melt onset; and (7) melt-season transitions also mark transitions in system responses to radiative energy flux changes because of invariant melt-season surface temperatures. The extensive SHEBA observations enable an understanding of the complex processes not available from other field program data. The analysis provides a basis for future testing of the generality of the results, and contributes to better physical understanding of multi-year analyses of melt-season trends from less extensive data sets.},

	Abstract = {The Greenland ice sheet has become one of the main contributors to global sea level rise, predominantly through increased meltwater runoff. The main drivers of Greenland ice sheet runoff, however, remain poorly understood. Here we show that clouds enhance meltwater runoff by about one-third relative to clear skies, using a unique combination of active satellite observations, climate model data and snow model simulations. This impact results from a cloud radiative effect of 29.5 ({$[$}plusmn{$]$}5.2){$[$}thinsp{$]$}W{$[$}thinsp{$]$}m-2. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, the Greenland ice sheet responds to this energy through a new pathway by which clouds reduce meltwater refreezing as opposed to increasing surface melt directly, thereby accelerating bare-ice exposure and enhancing meltwater runoff. The high sensitivity of the Greenland ice sheet to both ice-only and liquid-bearing clouds highlights the need for accurate cloud representations in climate models, to better predict future contributions of the Greenland ice sheet to global sea level rise.},

	Abstract = {Marine microgels play an important role in regulating ocean basin-scale biogeochemical dynamics. In this paper, we demonstrate that, in the high Arctic, marine gels with unique physicochemical characteristics originate in the organic material produced by ice algae and/or phytoplankton in the surface water. The polymers in this dissolved organic pool assembled faster and with higher microgel yields than at other latitudes. The reversible phase transitions shown by these Arctic marine gels, as a function of pH, dimethylsulfide, and dimethylsulfoniopropionate concentrations, stimulate the gels to attain sizes below 1 μm in diameter. These marine gels were identified with an antibody probe specific toward material from the surface waters, sized, and quantified in airborne aerosol, fog, and cloud water, strongly suggesting that they dominate the available cloud condensation nuclei number population in the high Arctic (north of 80$\,^{\circ}$N) during the summer season. Knowledge about emergent properties of marine gels provides important new insights into the processes controlling cloud formation and radiative forcing, and links the biology at the ocean surface with cloud properties and climate over the central Arctic Ocean and, probably, all oceans.},

	Abstract = { Abstract The relationship among clouds, surface radiation flux, and the sea surface temperature (SST) of the tropical western Pacific Ocean over the diurnal cycle is addressed in the context of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program scientific objectives for the tropical western Pacific Ocean. An understanding of the relationship between clouds and SST on a variety of time and space scales is needed to understand fully the cloud-radiation feedback in the tropical oceans and the maintenance of the warm pool. Here the diurnal cycle is emphasized. Data from the TOGA COARE Intensive Observation Period is examined and interpreted using an ocean mixed layer model that includes a parameterization of the ``skin'' temperature, explicit salinity, a surface beat budget that includes the sensible heat flux associated with rain, and the contribution of rain to the surface momentum flux. Using a mix of modeling and observations, three different case studies are examined in detail: clear and calm, clear and windy, and disturbed. For these typical sets of conditions and processes in the tropical ocean warm pool, the upper-ocean structure is clarified so that the skin sea surface temperature, the bulk surface temperature (at a depth of 1 cm), and the temperature at 0.5 and 5 m below the surface (which is the level that buoys and ships routinely observe ``surface'' temperature) can be interpreted. Sensitivity studies are conducted with the model to investigate the roles of wind speed, precipitation, ocean turbidity, and ocean initial state in modulating the radiation-induced diurnal cycle in SST. It is found that in high insolation, low wind regimes that the skin temperature may be as much as 30$\,^{\circ}$C warmer than the 0.5-m buoy temperature. Spatial distribution of the diurnal amplitude of the SST are calculated for the global Tropics, and speculations are made regarding the implication of the SST variability to the tropical climate. },

	Abstract = {General circulation models show that as the surface temperature increases, the convective anvil clouds shrink. By analyzing radiative--convective equilibrium simulations, we show that this behavior is rooted in basic energetic and thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere: As the climate warms, the clouds rise and remain at nearly the same temperature, but find themselves in a more stable atmosphere; this enhanced stability reduces the convective outflow in the upper troposphere and decreases the anvil cloud fraction. By warming the troposphere and increasing the upper-tropospheric stability, the clustering of deep convection also reduces the convective outflow and the anvil cloud fraction. When clouds are radiatively active, this robust coupling between temperature, high clouds, and circulation exerts a positive feedback on convective aggregation and favors the maintenance of strongly aggregated atmospheric states at high temperatures. This stability iris mechanism likely contributes to the narrowing of rainy areas as the climate warms. Whether or not it influences climate sensitivity requires further investigation.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Large-eddy simulations that incorporate a size-resolving representation of cloud water are used to study the effect of heavy drizzle on PBL structure. Simulated surface precipitation rates average about 1 mm day?1. Heavily drizzling simulations are compared to nondrizzling simulations under two nocturnal PBL regimes?one primarily driven by buoyancy and the other driven equally by buoyancy and shear. Drizzle implies a net latent heating in the cloud that leads to sharp reductions in both entrainment and the production of turbulent kinetic energy by buoyancy (particularly in downdrafts). Drizzle, which evaporates below cloud base, promotes a cooler and moister subcloud layer that further inhibits deep mixing. The cooling and moistening is in quantitative agreement with some observations and is shown to favor the formation of cumuli rising out of the subcloud layer. The cumuli, which are local in space and time, are responsible for most of the heat and moisture transport. They also appear to generate a larger-scale circulation that differs dramatically from the regularity typically found in nonprecipitating stratocumulus. Time-averaged turbulent fluxes of heat and moisture increase in the presence of precipitation, suggesting that drizzle (and drizzle-induced stratification) should not necessarily be taken as a sign of decoupling. Because drizzle primarily affects the vertical distribution of buoyancy, shear production of turbulent kinetic energy mitigates some of the effects described above. Based on large-eddy simulation the authors hypothesize that shallow, well-mixed, radiatively driven stratocumulus cannot persist in the presence of heavy drizzle. In accord with some simpler models, the simulated case with heavy precipitation promotes a reduction in both liquid-water path and entrainment. However, the simulations suggest that time-integrated cloud fraction may increase as a result of drizzle because thinner precipitating clouds may persist longer if the boundary layer does not deepen as rapidly. These somewhat more complicated dynamics have important implications for a number of hypotheses suggesting that changes in aerosol concentrations, when metabolized by stratocumulus, have a significant effect on climate.},

	Abstract = { Abstract The second Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS-II) field study is described. The field program consisted of nine flights in marine stratocumulus west-southwest of San Diego, California. The objective of the program was to better understand the physics and dynamics of marine stratocumulus. Toward this end special flight strategies, including predominantly nocturnal flights, were employed to optimize estimates of entrainment velocities at cloud-top, large-scale divergence within the boundary layer, drizzle processes in the cloud, cloud microstructure, and aerosol--cloud interactions. Cloud conditions during DYCOMS-II were excellent with almost every flight having uniformly overcast clouds topping a well-mixed boundary layer. Although the emphasis of the manuscript is on the goals and methodologies of DYCOMS-II, some preliminary findings are also presented---the most significant being that the cloud layers appear to entrain less and drizzle more than previous theoretical work led investigators to expect. },

	Abstract = {Trade wind regions cover most of the tropical oceans, and the prevailing cloud type is shallow cumulus. These small clouds are parameterized by climate models, and changes in their radiative effects strongly and directly contribute to the spread in estimates of climate sensitivity. This study investigates the structure and variability of these clouds in observations and climate models. The study builds upon recent detailed model evaluations using observations from the island of Barbados. Using a dynamical regimes framework, satellite and reanalysis products are used to compare the Barbados region and the broader tropics. It is shown that clouds in the Barbados region are similar to those across the trade wind regions, implying that observational findings from the Barbados Cloud Observatory are relevant to clouds across the tropics. The same methods are applied to climate models to evaluate the simulated clouds. The models generally capture the cloud radiative effect, but underestimate cloud cover and show an array of cloud vertical structures. Some models show strong biases in the environment of the Barbados region in summer, weakening the connection between the regional biases and those across the tropics. Even bearing that limitation in mind, it is shown that covariations of cloud and environmental properties in the models are inconsistent with observations. The models tend to misrepresent sensitivity to moisture variations and inversion characteristics. These model errors are likely connected to cloud feedback in climate projections, and highlight the importance of the representation of shallow cumulus convection.},

@article{Kay:2016,
	Abstract = { AbstractA large, long-standing, and pervasive climate model bias is excessive absorbed shortwave radiation (ASR) over the midlatitude oceans, especially the Southern Ocean. This study investigates both the underlying mechanisms for and climate impacts of this bias within the Community Earth System Model, version 1, with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 [CESM1(CAM5)]. Excessive Southern Ocean ASR in CESM1(CAM5) results in part because low-level clouds contain insufficient amounts of supercooled liquid. In a present-day atmosphere-only run, an observationally motivated modification to the shallow convection detrainment increases supercooled cloud liquid, brightens low-level clouds, and substantially reduces the Southern Ocean ASR bias. Tuning to maintain global energy balance enables reduction of a compensating tropical ASR bias. In the resulting preindustrial fully coupled run with a brighter Southern Ocean and dimmer tropics, the Southern Ocean cools and the tropics warm. As a result of the enhanced meridional temperature gradient, poleward heat transport increases in both hemispheres (especially the Southern Hemisphere), and the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric jet strengthens. Because northward cross-equatorial heat transport reductions occur primarily in the ocean (80\%), not the atmosphere (20\%), a proposed atmospheric teleconnection linking Southern Ocean ASR bias reduction and cooling with northward shifts in tropical precipitation has little impact. In summary, observationally motivated supercooled liquid water increases in shallow convective clouds enable large reductions in long-standing climate model shortwave radiation biases. Of relevance to both model bias reduction and climate dynamics, quantifying the influence of Southern Ocean cooling on tropical precipitation requires a model with dynamic ocean heat transport. },

	Abstract = { Abstract Decoupling during the ``Lagrangian'' evolution of a cloud-topped boundary layer advected equatorward by the trade winds in an idealized eastern subtropical ocean is studied using a mixed-layer model (MLM). The sea surface temperature is gradually warmed while the free tropospheric sounding remains unchanged, causing the boundary layer to deepen, the surface relative humidity to decrease, and surface latent heat fluxes to increase. Diurnally averaged insolation is used. For entrainment closures in which entrainment rate is related to a large-eddy convective velocity scale w*, the MLM predicts an increasingly prominent layer of negative buoyancy fluxes below cloud base as the sea surface temperature warms. Decoupling of the mixed layer can be inferred when the MLM-predicted negative buoyancy fluxes become too large for the internal circulations to sustain. The authors show that decoupling is mainly driven by an increasing ratio of the surface latent heat flux to the net radiative cooling in the cloud, and derive a decoupling criterion based on this ratio. Other effects such as drizzle, the vertical distribution of radiative cooling in the cloud, and sensible heat fluxes, also affect decoupling but are shown to be less important in typical subtropical boundary layers. A comparison of MLM results with a companion numerical study with a cloud-resolving model shows that the decoupling process is similar and the same decoupling criterion applies. A regional analysis of decoupling using Lagrangian trajectories based on summertime northeast Pacific climatology predicts decoupling throughout the subtropical stratocumulus region except in coastal zones where the boundary layer is under 750 m deep. A ``flux-partitioning'' entrainment closure, in which the entrainment rate is chosen to maintain a specified ratio of some measure of negative subcloud buoyancy fluxes to positive buoyancy fluxes within the cloud and near the surface, was also considered. By construction, such an MLM never predicts its own breakdown by decoupling. The changed entrainment closure had only a minor influence on the boundary layer evolution and entrainment rate. Instead, the crucial impact of the entrainment closure is on predicting when and where the mixed-layer assumption will break down due to decoupling. },

@article{Branstator:2014,
	Abstract = { AbstractThe midlatitude response to localized equatorial heating events that last 2 days is examined through experimentation with an atmospheric general circulation model. Such responses are argued to be important because many tropical rainfall events only last a short time and because the responses to such pulses serve as building blocks with which to study the impacts of more general heating fluctuations.The experiments indicate that short-lived heating produces responses in midlatitudes at locations far removed from the source and these responses persist much longer than the pulses themselves. Indeed pulse forcing, which is essentially white in time, produces upper-tropospheric responses that have an e-damping time of almost a week and that are detectable for more than two weeks in the experiments. Moreover the upper-tropospheric structure of the reaction to short pulses is remarkably similar to the reaction to steady tropical heating, including having a preference for occurring at special geographical locations and being composed of recurring patterns that resemble the leading patterns of responses to steady heating. This similarity is argued to be a consequence of the responses to pulses having little or no phase propagation in the extratropics. The impact of short-lived tropical heating also produces a persistent response in midlatitude surface fields and in the statistics of synoptic eddies.The implications these results have for subseasonal variability are discussed. These include 1) the potential for improving subseasonal prediction through improved assimilation and short-range forecasts of tropical precipitation and 2) the difficulties involved in attributing subseasonal midlatitude events to tropical heating. },

	Abstract = {Any initial value forecast of climate will be subject to errors originating from poorly known initial conditions, model imperfections, and by ``chaos'' in the sense that, even if the initial conditions were perfectly known, infinitesimal errors can amplify and spoil the forecast at some lead time. Here the latter source of error is examined using a ``perfect model'' approach whereby small perturbations are made to a coupled atmosphere--ocean general circulation model and the spread of nearby model trajectories, on time and space scales appropriate to seasonal-decadal climate variability, is measured to assess the lead time at which the error saturates. The study therefore represents an estimate of the upper limit of the predictability of climate (appropriate to the initial value problem) given a perfect model and near perfect knowledge of the initial conditions. It is found that, on average, surface air temperature anomalies are potentially predictable on seasonal to interannual time scales in the tropical regions and are potentially predictable on decadal time scales over the ocean in the North Atlantic. For mid-latitude surface air temperature anomalies over land, model trajectories rapidly diverge and there is little sign of any potential predictability on time scales greater than a season or so. For mean sea level pressure anomalies, there is potential predictability on seasonal time scales in the tropics, and for some global scale annual-decadal anomalies, although not those associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation. For precipitation, the only potential for predictability is for seasonal time anomalies associated with the El-Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation. For the majority of the highly populated regions of the world, climate predictability on interannual to decadal time scales based in the initial value approach is likely to be severely limited by chaotic error growth. It is found however that there can be cases in which the potential predictability can be higher than average indicating that there is perhaps some utility in making initial value forecasts of climate in those regions which show low predictability on average.},

@article{OGorman:2010,
	Abstract = {The factors governing the rate of change in the amount of atmospheric water vapor are analyzed in simulations of climate change. The global-mean amount of water vapor is estimated to increase at a differential rate of 7.3% K − 1 with respect to global-mean surface air temperature in the multi-model mean. Larger rates of change result if the fractional change is evaluated over a finite change in temperature (e.g., 8.2% K − 1 for a 3 K warming), and rates of change of zonal-mean column water vapor range from 6 to 12% K − 1 depending on latitude. Clausius--Clapeyron scaling is directly evaluated using an invariant distribution of monthly-mean relative humidity, giving a rate of 7.4% K − 1 for global-mean water vapor. There are deviations from Clausius--Clapeyron scaling of zonal-mean column water vapor in the tropics and mid-latitudes, but they largely cancel in the global mean. A purely thermodynamic scaling based on a saturated troposphere gives a higher global rate of 7.9% K − 1 . Surface specific humidity increases at a rate of 5.7% K − 1 , considerably lower than the rate for global-mean water vapor. Surface specific humidity closely follows Clausius--Clapeyron scaling over ocean. But there are widespread decreases in surface relative humidity over land (by more than 1% K − 1 in many regions), and it is argued that decreases of this magnitude could result from the land/ocean contrast in surface warming.},

	Abstract = {How tropical low clouds change with climate remains the dominant source of uncertainty in global warming projections. An analysis of an ensemble of CMIP5 climate models reveals that a significant part of the spread in the models' climate sensitivity can be accounted by differences in the climatological shallowness of tropical low clouds in weak-subsidence regimes: models with shallower low clouds in weak-subsidence regimes tend to have a higher climate sensitivity than models with deeper low clouds. The dynamical mechanisms responsible for the model differences are analyzed. Competing effects of parameterized boundary-layer turbulence and shallow convection are found to be essential. Boundary-layer turbulence and shallow convection are typically represented by distinct parameterization schemes in current models---parameterization schemes that often produce opposing effects on low clouds. Convective drying of the boundary layer tends to deepen low clouds and reduce the cloud fraction at the lowest levels; turbulent moistening tends to make low clouds more shallow but affects the low-cloud fraction less. The relative importance different models assign to these opposing mechanisms contributes to the spread of the climatological shallowness of low clouds and thus to the spread of low-cloud changes under global warming.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The role of the atmospheric circulation as a ?bridge? between sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific and those in the midlatitude northern oceans is assessed. The key processes associated with this atmospheric bridge are described using output from four independent simulations with a general circulation model subjected to month to month SST variations observed in the tropical Pacific during the 1946?1988 period and to climatological SST conditions elsewhere (the ?TOGA? runs). In episodes with prominent SST anomalies in the tropical Pacific, extratropical perturbations in the simulated atmospheric temperature, humidity, and wind fields induce changes in the latent and sensible heat fluxes across the air-sea interface of the midlatitude oceans. These anomalous fluxes in turn lead to extratropical SST changes. The relevance of the atmospheric bridge mechanism is evaluated by driving a motionless, 50-m deep oceanic negative mixed layer model at individual grid points with the local surface fluxes generated in the TOGA runs. The negative feedback of the mixed layer temperature anomalies on the imposed flux forcing is taken into account by introducing a linear damping term with a 5-mouth dissipative time scale. This simple system reproduces the basic spatial and temporal characteristics of the observed SST variability in the North Pacific and western North Atlantic. The two-way air-sea feedbacks associated with the atmospheric bridge are investigated by performing four additional 43-year runs of a modified version of the TOGA Experiment. These new ?TOGA-ML? runs predict the ocean temperature outside the tropical Pacific by allowing the atmosphere to interact fully with the same mixed layer model mentioned above. The results support the notion that midlatitude ocean-atmosphere interaction can be modeled as a first-order Markov process, in which the red-noise response of mixed layer temperature is driven by white?noise atmospheric forcing in the presence of linear damping. The amplitude of near-surface atmospheric anomalies appearing in the TOGA-ML runs is higher than that in the TOGA runs. This finding implies that, in the TOGA-ML scenario, the midlatitude oceanic responses to atmospheric driving could exert positive feedbacks on the atmosphere, thereby reinforcing the air-sea coupling. The enhanced atmosphere-ocean interactions operating in TOGA-ML prolong the duration of persistent meteorological episodes in that experiment. A comprehensive survey is conducted of the persistence characteristics simulated in TOGA, TOGA- ML, and several other experiments subjected to prescribed SST forcing at various sites.

	Abstract = {Abstract An observational and modeling study is made of tropical-extratropical interactions on time scales relevant to medium and extended range forecasting. First, an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is made of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) in the tropics over seven winters. Having removed the seasonal cycle and interannual variability, the two leading EOFs describe the 30?60 day oscillation. A composite of extratropical 500 mb geopotential height correlated simultaneously with this mode of tropical variability is constructed. In its two phase-quadrature components, this composite has significant projection onto the Pacific/North American teleconnection pattern and onto the North Atlantic oscillation pattern, respectively. The 500 mb height composite is compared with the Simmons, Wallace and Branstator (SWB) mode of barotropic instability, which has similar periodicity and similar spatial structure in both its phase-quadrature components. A simple theoretical analysis shows that the SWB mode can be strongly excited by a periodic forcing in the tropics whose spatial structure resembles the oscillation in convective activity described by the first two EOFs of OLR. This is confirmed in a barotropic model integration, which is forced using the observed EOFs of OLR. The model response in the extratropics compares well with the observed composite oscillation in 500 mb height. In the final phase of this study, the ECMWF model has been integrated over four wintertime 20-day periods. For each period, five integrations have been performed; a control forecast, an integration in which the tropics are relaxed towards the verifying analysis, an integration in which the tropics are relaxed towards the initial analysis, an integration in which the extratropics are relaxed towards the verifying analysis and finally an integration in which the extratropics are relaxed towards the initial analysis. The four initial dates were chosen on the basis that in the succeeding 20 days, observed OLR and extratropical height provided a reasonable realization of each separate quarter of the composite oscillation. It was found that in the extratropics, skill scores in the range of 11?20 days were noticeably improved, particularly over the Pacific/North American region (consistent with expectations from the data analysis). The mean geopotential height error in the extratropics; i.e., the error averaged over the four experiments, was also reduced (mainly in the Pacific area) when the model tropical fields were relaxed towards the verifying analysis. Indeed, maps showing the time evolution of geopotential height from the first 5 days of the forecast were generally correlated with the differences between the integrations with tropics relaxed to the verifying analysis and to the initial analysis indicating a link between tropical and extratropical low-frequency variability. The impact of the extratropics on the tropics was also studied where it was shown that the largest response was on the nondivergent component of the wind over the tropical east Pacific. Tropical skill scores and model systematic error in upper tropospheric streamfunction were significantly improved with the extratropics relaxed to the verifying analysis. By contrast, extratropical relaxation had a much smaller impact on the divergent component of the tropical wind.},

	N2 = {Abstract An observational and modeling study is made of tropical-extratropical interactions on time scales relevant to medium and extended range forecasting. First, an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is made of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) in the tropics over seven winters. Having removed the seasonal cycle and interannual variability, the two leading EOFs describe the 30?60 day oscillation. A composite of extratropical 500 mb geopotential height correlated simultaneously with this mode of tropical variability is constructed. In its two phase-quadrature components, this composite has significant projection onto the Pacific/North American teleconnection pattern and onto the North Atlantic oscillation pattern, respectively.

@article{Beals:2015,
	Abstract = {When clouds mix with drier air because of atmospheric turbulence, some of the cloud droplets evaporate. Beals et al. developed an airborne holographic imaging system to look at changes in the spatial structure and sizes of these droplets (see the Perspective by Bodenschatz). Turbulent mixing of clouds with clear air caused dramatic fluctuations in the number density of water droplets but left their mean diameter essentially unchanged. This finding should help models better represent these hard-to-parameterize cloud processes.Science, this issue p. 87; see also p. 40Optical properties and precipitation efficiency of atmospheric clouds are largely determined by turbulent mixing with their environment. When cloud liquid water is reduced upon mixing, droplets may evaporate uniformly across the population or, in the other extreme, a subset of droplets may evaporate completely, leaving the remaining drops unaffected. Here, we use airborne holographic imaging to visualize the spatial structure and droplet size distribution at the smallest turbulent scales, thereby observing their response to entrainment and mixing with clear air. The measurements reveal that turbulent clouds are inhomogeneous, with sharp transitions between cloud and clear air properties persisting to dissipative scales (\&lt;1 centimeter). The local droplet size distribution fluctuates strongly in number density but with a nearly unchanging mean droplet diameter.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The interaction between high-frequency transient disturbances and convection, and the Madden?Julian Oscillation (MJO), is investigated using NCEP?NCAR reanalysis and satellite outgoing longwave radiation data for 15 northern winters. During the phase of the MJO with enhanced convection over the East Indian Ocean and Indonesia, and suppressed convection over the South Pacific convergence zone, both the Asian?Pacific jet and the region of upper-tropospheric tropical easterlies over the warm pool are displaced westward. These changes in the basic state lead to a weaker or ?leakier? waveguide in the Asian?Pacific jet, with a westward-displaced ?forbidden? region of tropical easterlies, such that high-frequency transient waves propagate equatorward into the deep Tropics over the central Pacific near the date line. As these waves induce convection in the region of ascent and reduced static stability ahead of the upper-level cyclonic disturbances, there is an enhancement of high-frequency convective variability over the central Pacific intertropical convergence zone during this phase of the MJO. This enhanced high-frequency convective variability appears to project back onto intraseasonal timescales and forms an integral part of the slowly varying diabatic heating field of the MJO. In the opposite phase of the MJO, the Asian?Pacific jet is extended eastward and there is an almost continuous waveguide across the Pacific. Together with the expanded forbidden region of tropical easterlies over the warm pool, this leads to a more zonal propagation of high-frequency transients along the waveguide with less equatorward propagation, and hence reduced high-frequency convective variability over the tropical central Pacific.

The tropical circulation evolves through feedbacks between the surface wind, evaporation, and SST (the WES feedback), as well as through changes in the shortwave radiative heat flux (caused by changes in convection). Sensitivity experiments are run to investigate how thermodynamic coupling and seasonality affect the tropical response to NPO-related forcing. Seasonality is found to affect the WES feedback through (i) altering the sensitivity of surface evaporation to changes in the low-level wind field and (ii) altering the structure and strength of the lower-level wind response to SST anomalies.

Thermodynamic coupling causes an equatorward and westward development of SST anomalies and an associated equatorward shift in the lower-level zonal wind anomalies.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A global barotropic model, linearized about the 300 mb climatological mean January flow, is perturbed by applying a series of localized forcings distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics. Structures which resemble the observed ?Pacific/North American? and ?East Atlantic? teleconnection patterns noted by Wallace and Gutzler (1981) tend to recur in the responses. Similar patterns are found to result from the dispersion of isolated initial perturbations placed at a variety of locations in the tropics and midlatitudes. It is shown that these structures are related to the most rapidly growing mode associated with barotropic instability of the zonally-varying climatological basic state. In the absence of damping, this mode has an e-folding time of about a week and a period close to 50 days. In localized regions the instantaneous growth rates can be competitive with those of baroclinic instability. These episodes of rapid local barotropic growth are interspersed with intervals in which the local perturbation relaxes as energy disperses throughout the hemisphere. Some of the less unstable modes exhibit a similar structure and time evolution, while others are spatially fixed and grow exponentially in time, without any periodic modulation. The dominant processes by which the growing disturbances extract kinetic energy from the basic state can be described in terms of two conversion terms: ?u?v???/?y and (v?2?u?2)??/?x, where u and v are the velocity components in the zonal (x) and meridional (y) directions, respectively, primes refer to the perturbations, and overbars to the basic state. In the fastest growing mode the dominant process contributing to the growth is found to be the second term, which is largest in the Pacific jet exit region where u?2 ? v?2. Nonlinear initial value calculations for weak damping rates exhibit strong low-frequency oscillations similar in structure and period to those of the most unstable mode. Nonlinear forced solutions show some sensitivity to the polarity of the forcing and they tend to show a larger response in the time average over the first month of the integration than in longer term means. Sensitivity to model resolution, dissipation, and choice of basic state is illustrated by means of selected experiments. On the basis of these results and recent work by Hoskins et al.

	Abstract = {General circulation models (GCMs) of the climate system are powerful tools for understanding and predicting climate and climate change. The last glacial maximum (LGM) provides an extreme test of the model's ability to simulate a change of climate, and allows us to increase our understanding of mechanisms of climate change. We have used a coupled high resolution ocean--atmosphere GCM (HadCM3) to simulate the equilibrium climate at the LGM. The effect of ocean dynamics is investigated by carrying out a parallel experiment replacing the dynamic three-dimensional ocean GCM with a static thermodynamic mixed-layer ocean model. Changes to the ocean circulation, and feedbacks between the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice have an important influence on the surface response, and are discussed. The coupled model produces an intensified thermohaline circulation and an increase in the amount of heat transported northward by the Atlantic Ocean equatorward of 55{\textdegree}N, which is at odds with the interpretation of some proxy records. Such changes, which the thermodynamic mixed-layer ocean model cannot produce, have a large impact around the North Atlantic region, and are discussed in the study.},

	Abstract = {The distinctive feature of tidally locked exoplanets is the very uneven heating by stellar radiation between the dayside and nightside. Previous work has focused on the role of atmospheric heat transport in preventing atmospheric collapse on the nightside for terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zone around M dwarfs. In the present paper, we carry out simulations with a fully coupled atmosphere--ocean general circulation model to investigate the role of ocean heat transport in climate states of tidally locked habitable exoplanets around M dwarfs. Our simulation results demonstrate that ocean heat transport substantially extends the area of open water along the equator, showing a lobster-like spatial pattern of open water, instead of an ``eyeball.'' For sufficiently high-level greenhouse gases or strong stellar radiation, ocean heat transport can even lead to complete deglaciation of the nightside. Our simulations also suggest that ocean heat transport likely narrows the width of M dwarfs' habitable zone. This study provides a demonstration of the importance of exooceanography in determining climate states and habitability of exoplanets.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The equilibrium climate sensitivity of a climate model is usually defined as the globally averaged equilibrium surface temperature response to a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is virtually always estimated in a version with a slab model for the upper ocean. The question is whether this estimate is accurate for the full climate model version, which includes a full-depth ocean component. This question has been answered for the low-resolution version of the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3). The answer is that the equilibrium climate sensitivity using the full-depth ocean model is 0.14$\,^{\circ}$C higher than that using the slab ocean model, which is a small increase. In addition, these sensitivity estimates have a standard deviation of nearly 0.1$\,^{\circ}$C because of interannual variability.

This is virtually always estimated in a version with a slab model for the upper ocean. The question is whether this estimate is accurate for the full climate model version, which includes a full-depth ocean component. This question has been answered for the low-resolution version of the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3). The answer is that the equilibrium climate sensitivity using the full-depth ocean model is 0.14$\,^{\circ}$C higher than that using the slab ocean model, which is a small increase.

The annual-mean tropical precipitation change is typically described as arising from an annual-mean change in the mean atmospheric circulation.

Here, the role of seasonality of tropical humidity is assessed using reanalysis and idealized atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) simulations perturbed by sulfate aerosol radiative forcing. When coupled to an aquaplanet slab ocean with low thermal inertia, the seasonal cycle in GCM simulations of the ?continental? regime is large and the annual-mean precipitation change depends on both the seasonally varying perturbation mean meridional circulation and the seasonally varying climatological specific humidity. When coupled to an aquaplanet slab ocean with a higher thermal inertia, the seasonal cycle in GCM simulations of the ?oceanic? regime is smaller and the annual-mean precipitation change can be approximated by considering the perturbation convergence of the water vapor flux of the annual-mean perturbation mean meridional circulation and the annual-mean climatological specific humidity. The results of the aquaplanet simulations taken together with the magnitude of the seasonality of humidity in an atmospheric reanalysis suggest that the simplest forms of energetic arguments for the tropical precipitation response to perturbations in the atmospheric energy budget, which neglect an explicit role for the seasonality of the radiative forcing and the climatological specific humidity, are not quantitatively accurate for Earth?s tropical land regions.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A study has been made of the dynamic interactions between the surface layer of the ocean and the atmosphere using a climate model that contains a new approach to predicting the sea surface temperature (SST). The atmospheric conditions are simulated numerically with the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM3). The SST is determined by a modified Kraus?Turner-type one-dimensional mixed layer ocean model (MLOM) for the upper ocean that has been coupled to CCM3. The MLOM simulates vertical ocean dynamics and demonstrates the effects of the seasonal variation of mixed layer depth and convective instability on the SST. A purely thermodynamic slab ocean model (SOM) is currently available for use with CCM3 to predict the SST. A large-scale ocean general circulation model (OGCM) may also be coupled to CCM3; however, the OGCM is computationally intensive and is therefore not a good tool for conducting multiple sensitivity studies. The MLOM provides an alternative to the SOM that contains seasonally and spatially specified mixed layer depths. The SOM also contains a heat flux correction called Q-flux that crudely accounts for ocean heat transport by artificially specifying a heat flux that forces the SOM to replicate the observed SST. The results of the coupled MLOM?CCM3 reveal that the MLOM may be used on a global scale and can therefore replace the standard coupled SOM?CCM3 that contains no explicit ocean dynamics. Additionally, stand-alone experiments of the MLOM that are forced with realistic winds, heat, and moisture fluxes show that the MLOM closely approximates the observed seasonal cycle of SST.},

	Abstract = {Few internally forced large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns exhibit periodic behavior, and those that do are centered in the tropics. Identifying these periodic processes is important for understanding the dynamics of weather. Thompson and Barnes (p. 641) report the discovery of a 20- to 30-day periodicity in the atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere. The oscillation could potentially drive large-scale climate variability throughout much of the mid-latitude Southern Hemisphere. Periodic behavior in the climate system has important implications not only for weather prediction but also for understanding and interpreting the physical processes that drive climate variability. Here we demonstrate that the large-scale Southern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation exhibits marked periodicity on time scales of approximately 20 to 30 days. The periodicity is tied to the Southern Hemisphere baroclinic annular mode and emerges in hemispheric-scale averages of the eddy fluxes of heat, the eddy kinetic energy, and precipitation. Observational and theoretical analyses suggest that the oscillation results from feedbacks between the extratropical baroclinicity, the wave fluxes of heat, and radiative damping. The oscillation plays a potentially profound role in driving large-scale climate variability throughout much of the mid-latitude Southern Hemisphere.},

	Abstract = {A series of schemes designed to include various representations of the Ekman-driven heat fluxes in slab-ocean models is introduced. They work by computing an Ekman mass flux, then deducing heat fluxes by the surface flow and an opposite deep return flow. The schemes differ by the computation of the return flow temperature: either diagnosed from the SST or given by an active second layer. Both schemes conserve energy, and use as few parameters as possible. Simulations in an aquaplanet setting show that the schemes reproduce well the structure of the meridional heat transport by the ocean. Compared to a diffusive slab-ocean, the simulated SST is more flat in the tropics, and presents a relative minimum at the equator, shifting the ITCZ into the summer hemisphere. In a realistic setting with continents, the slab model simulates correctly the mean state in many regions, especially in the tropics. The lack of other dynamical features, such as barotropic gyres, means that an optimal mean-state in regions such as the mid-latitudes will require additional flux corrections.},

	Abstract = {Climate models robustly simulate weakened mean circulations of the tropical atmosphere in direct response to increased carbon dioxide (CO2). The direct response to CO2, defined by the response to radiative forcing in the absence of changes in sea surface temperature, affects tropical precipitation and tropical cyclone genesis, and these changes have been tied to the weakening of the mean tropical circulation. The mechanism underlying this direct CO2-forced circulation change has not been elucidated. Here, I demonstrate that this circulation weakening results from spatial structure in CO2's radiative forcing. In regions of ascending circulation, such as the intertropical convergence zone, the CO2 radiative forcing is reduced, or ``masked,'' by deep-convective clouds and high humidity; in subsiding regions, such as the subtropics, the CO2 radiative forcing is larger because the atmosphere is drier and deep-convective clouds are infrequent. The spatial structure of the radiative forcing reduces the need for the atmosphere to transport energy. This, in turn, weakens the mass overturning of the tropical circulation. The previously unidentified mechanism is demonstrated in a hierarchy of atmospheric general circulation model simulations with altered radiative transfer to suppress the cloud masking of the radiative forcing. The mechanism depends on the climatological distribution of clouds and humidity, rather than uncertain changes in these quantities. Masked radiative forcing thereby offers an explanation for the robustness of the direct circulation weakening under increased CO2.},

	Abstract = {The effect of ocean mixed layer depth on climate is explored in a suite of slab ocean aquaplanet simulations with different mixed layer depths ranging from a globally uniform value of 50--2.4 m. In addition to the expected increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in temperature with decreasing ocean mixed layer depth, the simulated climates differ in several less intuitive ways including fundamental changes in the annual mean climate. The phase of seasonal cycle in temperature differs non-monotonically with increasing ocean mixed layer depth, reaching a maximum in the 12 m slab depth simulation. This result is a consequence of the change in the source of the seasonal heating of the atmosphere across the suite of simulations. In the shallow ocean runs, the seasonal heating of the atmosphere is dominated by the surface energy fluxes whereas the seasonal heating is dominated by direct shortwave absorption within the atmospheric column in the deep ocean runs. The surface fluxes are increasingly lagged with respect to the insolation as the ocean deepens which accounts for the increase in phase lag from the shallow to mid-depth runs. The direct shortwave absorption is in phase with insolation, and thus the total heating comes back in phase with the insolation as the ocean deepens more and the direct shortwave absorption dominates the seasonal heating of the atmosphere. The intertropical convergence zone follows the seasonally varying insolation and maximum sea surface temperatures into the summer hemisphere in the shallow ocean runs whereas it stays fairly close to the equator in the deep ocean runs. As a consequence, the tropical precipitation and region of high planetary albedo is spread more broadly across the low latitudes in the shallow runs, resulting in an apparent expansion of the tropics relative to the deep ocean runs. As a result, the global and annual mean planetary albedo is substantially (20 \%) higher in the shallow ocean simulations which results in a colder (7C) global and annual mean surface temperature. The increased tropical planetary albedo in the shallow ocean simulations also results in a decreased equator-to-pole gradient in absorbed shortwave radiation and drives a severely reduced (≈50 \%) meridional energy transport relative to the deep ocean runs. As a result, the atmospheric eddies are weakened and shifted poleward (away from the high albedo tropics) and the eddy driven jet is also reduced and shifted poleward by 15{\textdegree} relative to the deep ocean run.},

Sensitivity tests with AGCM4 show a marked effect of the parameterization of shallow convection in the model. In particular, including the parameterization of shallow convection produces considerably enhanced vertical mixing and decreased stratiform cloud amounts in the lower subtropical atmosphere over the oceans. The differences in simulated stratiform cloud amounts are associated with a change in the globally averaged outgoing shortwave radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere of about 11 W m−2. Additionally, precipitation rates are considerably reduced for stratiform clouds and enhanced for convective clouds in the subtropics, if the parameterization of shallow convection is included in the model. Additional tests show that the simulated responses in cloud amounts and precipitation to the treatment of shallow convection are robust. Additional simulations with modified closures for deep convection and other changes to the treatment of convection in the model still lead to similar responses of the model results.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this study, the mean and variability of boundary layer height (BLH) are analyzed along a transect in the eastern Pacific Ocean for the summer of 2003 using BLH estimates based on the height of the main relative humidity (RH) inversion and the height of low cloud tops (CTH). The observations and the regional and global model data have been prepared in the context of the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud System Study (GCSS) Pacific Cross-Section Intercomparison (GPCI). The GPCI transect covers the transition from a stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer (MBL) off the coast of California to a trade cumulus?topped, less-well-defined, MBL, and finally to the deep-convection regions in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) have been used to derive observational records of the two BLH estimates.

The observations and the regional and global model data have been prepared in the context of the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud System Study (GCSS) Pacific Cross-Section Intercomparison (GPCI). The GPCI transect covers the transition from a stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer (MBL) off the coast of California to a trade cumulus?topped, less-well-defined, MBL, and finally to the deep-convection regions in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) have been used to derive observational records of the two BLH estimates. Analyses from the ECMWF are also used in the study. Both BLH estimates in the models, the ECMWF analysis, and the observations agree on a southward vertical growth of the MBL along the GPCI transect in the stratocumulus region.

	Abstract = {The stability of the lower troposphere along the east side of the sub-tropical North Atlantic is analyzed and characterized using upper air meteorological long-term records at the Canary Islands (Tenerife), Madeira (Madeira) and Azores (Terceira) archipelagos. The most remarkable characteristic is the strong stratification observed in the lower troposphere, with a strengthening of stability centred at levels near 900 and 800 hPa in a significant percentage of soundings (ranging from 17 \% in Azores to 33 \% in G{\"u}imar, Canary Islands). We show that this double structure is associated with the top of the marine boundary layer (MBL) and the trade-wind inversion (TWI) respectively. The top of the MBL coincides with the base of the first temperature inversion (                                                                          \$\${\backslash}approx \$\$                                                            ≈                                                      900 hPa) where a sharp change in water vapour mixing ratio is observed. A second temperature inversion is found near 800 hPa, which is characterized by a large directional wind shear just above the inversion layer, tied to the TWI. We find that seasonal and latitudinal variations of the height and strength of both temperature inversions are driven by large-scale subsiding air from the upper troposphere associated with the descent branch of the Hadley cell. Increased general subsidence in summertime enhances stability in the lower troposphere, more markedly in the southern stations, where the inversion-layer heights are found at lower levels enhancing the main features of these two temperature inversions. A simple conceptual model that explains the lower tropospheric inversion enhancement by subsidence is proposed.},

@article{Qu:2014b,
	Abstract = {We examine the tropical inversion strength, measured by the estimated inversion strength (EIS), and its response to climate change in 18 models associated with phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP5). While CMIP5 models generally capture the geographic distribution of observed EIS, they systematically underestimate it off the west coasts of continents, due to a warm bias in sea surface temperature. The negative EIS bias may contribute to the low bias in tropical low-cloud cover in the same models. Idealized perturbation experiments reveal that anthropogenic forcing leads directly to EIS increases, independent of ``temperature-mediated'' EIS increases associated with long-term oceanic warming. This fast EIS response to anthropogenic forcing is strongly impacted by nearly instantaneous continental warming. The temperature-mediated EIS change has contributions from both uniform and non-uniform oceanic warming. The substantial EIS increases in uniform oceanic warming simulations are due to warming with height exceeding the moist adiabatic lapse rate in tropical warm pools. EIS also increases in fully-coupled ocean--atmosphere simulations where                                                                           \$\${\backslash}hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$                                                                                    CO                        2                                                                             concentration is instantaneously quadrupled, due to both fast and temperature-mediated changes. The temperature-mediated EIS change varies with tropical warming in a nonlinear fashion: The EIS change per degree tropical warming is much larger in the early stage of the simulations than in the late stage, due to delayed warming in the eastern parts of the subtropical oceans. Given the importance of EIS in regulating tropical low-cloud cover, this suggests that the tropical low-cloud feedback may also be nonlinear.},

@article{Webb:2012,
	Abstract = {We diagnose climate feedback parameters and CO2 forcing including rapid adjustment in twelve atmosphere/mixed-layer-ocean (``slab'') climate models from the CMIP3/CFMIP-1 project (the AR4 ensemble) and fifteen parameter-perturbed versions of the HadSM3 slab model (the PPE). In both ensembles, differences in climate feedbacks can account for approximately twice as much of the range in climate sensitivity as differences in CO2 forcing. In the AR4 ensemble, cloud effects can explain the full range of climate sensitivities, and cloud feedback components contribute four times as much as cloud components of CO2 forcing to the range. Non-cloud feedbacks are required to fully account for the high sensitivities of some models however. The largest contribution to the high sensitivity of HadGEM1 is from a high latitude clear-sky shortwave feedback, and clear-sky longwave feedbacks contribute substantially to the highest sensitivity members of the PPE. Differences in low latitude ocean regions (30{\textdegree}N/S) contribute more to the range than those in mid-latitude oceans (30--55{\textdegree}N/S), low/mid latitude land (55{\textdegree}N/S) or high latitude ocean/land (55--90{\textdegree}N/S), but contributions from these other regions are required to account fully for the higher model sensitivities, for example from land areas in IPSL CM4. Net cloud feedback components over the low latitude oceans sorted into percentile ranges of lower tropospheric stability (LTS) show largest differences among models in stable regions, mainly due to their shortwave components, most of which are positive in spite of increasing LTS. Differences in the mid-stability range are smaller, but cover a larger area, contributing a comparable amount to the range in climate sensitivity. These are strongly anti-correlated with changes in subsidence. Cloud components of CO2 forcing also show the largest differences in stable regions, and are strongly anticorrelated with changes in estimated inversion strength (EIS). This is qualitatively consistent with what would be expected from observed relationships between EIS and low-level cloud fraction. We identify a number of cases where individual models show unusually strong forcings and feedbacks compared to other members of the ensemble. We encourage modelling groups to investigate unusual model behaviours further with sensitivity experiments. Most of the models fail to correctly reproduce the observed relationships between stability and cloud radiative effect in the subtropics, indicating that there remains considerable room for model improvements in the future.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate changes in the Hadley Circulation (HC) and their connections to increased global dryness (suppressed rainfall and reduced tropospheric relative humidity) under CO2 warming from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model projections. We find a strengthening of the HC manifested in a ``deep-tropics squeeze'' (DTS), i.e., a deepening and narrowing of the convective zone, enhanced ascent, increased high clouds, suppressed low clouds, and a rise of the level of maximum meridional mass outflow in the upper troposphere (200−100 hPa) of the deep tropics. The DTS induces atmospheric moisture divergence and reduces tropospheric relative humidity in the tropics and subtropics, in conjunction with a widening of the subsiding branches of the HC, resulting in increased frequency of dry events in preferred geographic locations worldwide. Among various water-cycle parameters examined, global dryness is found to have the highest signal-to-noise ratio. Our results provide a physical basis for inferring that greenhouse warming is likely to contribute to the observed prolonged droughts worldwide in recent decades.},

	Abstract = {It has been pointed out that climatological-mean precipitation-evaporation difference (P--E) should increase under global warming mainly through the increasing saturation level of moisture. This study focuses on evaporation changes under global warming and their dependency on the direct warming effect, on the basis of future projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Over most of the tropical, subtropical and midlatitude regions, the direct contribution from surface temperature increase is found to dominate the projected increase in evaporation. This contribution is nevertheless offset partially, especially over the oceans, by contributions from weakening surface winds and increasing near-surface relative humidity. Greater warming of surface air than of the sea surface also acts to reduce surface evaporation, by reducing both the exchange coefficient and humidity contrast at the surface. Though generally of secondary importance, this contribution is the dominant factor over the subpolar oceans. Over the polar oceans, the effect of sea-ice retreat dominantly contributes to the evaporation increase in winter, whereas the reduced exchange coefficient and surface humidity contrast coupled with the sea-ice retreat account for most of the response during summertime. Over the continents, changes in the surface exchange coefficient, reflecting changes in soil moisture and vegetation among other factors, are important to modulate the direct effects of the warming and the generally reduced surface air relative humidity.},

	Abstract = {There is growing evidence that the role internal variability plays in our confidence in future climate projections has been under-appreciated in past assessments of model projections for the coming decades. In light of this, a 15 member ensemble has been produced to complement the existing 30 member ``Large Ensemble'' conducted with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). In contrast to the Large Ensemble, which explored the variability in RCP8.5, our new ensemble uses the moderate mitigation scenario represented by RCP4.5. By comparing outputs from these two ensembles, we assess at what point in the future the climates conditioned on the two scenarios will begin to significantly diverge. We find in general that while internal variability is a significant component of uncertainty for periods before 2050, there is evidence of a significantly increased risk of extreme warm events in some regions as early as 2030 in RCP8.5 relative to RCP4.5. Furthermore, the period 2061-2080 sees largely separate joint distributions of annual mean temperature and precipitation in most regions for the two ensembles. Hence, in the CESM's representation of the Earth System for the latter portion of the 21st century, the range of climatic states which might be expected in the RCP8.5 scenario is significantly and detectably further removed from today's climate state than the RCP4.5 scenario even in the presence of internal variability.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThe role of wind speed on shallow marine cumulus convection is explored using large-eddy simulations and concepts from bulk theory. Focusing on cases characteristic of the trades, the equilibrium trade wind layer is found to be deeper at stronger winds, with larger surface moisture fluxes and smaller surface heat fluxes. The opposing behavior of the surface fluxes is caused by more warm and dry air being mixed to the surface as the cloud layer deepens. This leads to little difference in equilibrium surface buoyancy fluxes and cloud-base mass fluxes. Shallow cumuli are deeper, but not more numerous or more energetic. The deepening response is necessary to resolve an inconsistency in the subcloud layer. This argument follows from bulk concepts and assumes that the lapse rate and flux divergence of moist-conserved variables do not change, based on simulation results. With that assumption, stronger winds and a fixed inversion height imply larger surface moisture and buoyancy fluxes (heat fluxes are small initially). The consequent moistening tends to decrease cloud-base height, which is inconsistent with a larger surface buoyancy flux that tends to increase cloud-base height, in order to maintain the buoyancy flux at cloud base at a fixed fraction of its surface value (entrainment closure). Deepening the cloud layer by increasing the inversion height resolves this inconsistency by allowing the surface buoyancy flux to remain constant without further moistening the subcloud layer. Because this explanation follows from simple bulk concepts, it is suggested that the internal dynamics (mixing) of clouds is only secondary to the deepening response.},

@article{Zarzycki:2015a,
	Abstract = {AbstractTropical cyclone (TC) forecasts at 14-km horizontal resolution (0.125$\,^{\circ}$) are completed using variable-resolution (V-R) grids within the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). Forecasts are integrated twice daily from 1 August to 31 October for both 2012 and 2013, with a high-resolution nest centered over the North Atlantic and eastern Pacific Ocean basins. Using the CAM version 5 (CAM5) physical parameterization package, regional refinement is shown to significantly increase TC track forecast skill relative to unrefined grids (55 km, 0.5$\,^{\circ}$). For typical TC forecast integration periods (approximately 1 week), V-R forecasts are able to nearly identically reproduce the flow field of a globally uniform high-resolution forecast. Simulated intensity is generally too strong for forecasts beyond 72 h.

Forecasts are integrated twice daily from 1 August to 31 October for both 2012 and 2013, with a high-resolution nest centered over the North Atlantic and eastern Pacific Ocean basins. Using the CAM version 5 (CAM5) physical parameterization package, regional refinement is shown to significantly increase TC track forecast skill relative to unrefined grids (55 km, 0.5$\,^{\circ}$). For typical TC forecast integration periods (approximately 1 week), V-R forecasts are able to nearly identically reproduce the flow field of a globally uniform high-resolution forecast. Simulated intensity is generally too strong for forecasts beyond 72 h.

	Abstract = {A simple method for initializing coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) using only sea surface temperature (SST) data is comprehensively tested in an extended set of ensemble hindcasts with the Max-Planck-Institute (MPI) climate model, MPI-OM/ECHAM5. In the scheme, initial conditions for both atmosphere and ocean are generated by running the coupled model with SST nudged strongly to observations. Air--sea interaction provides the mechanism through which SST influences the subsurface. Comparison with observations indicates that the scheme is performing well in the tropical Pacific. Results from a 500-yr control run show that the model's El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability is quite realistic, in terms of strength, structure and period. The hindcasts performed were six months long, initiated four times per year, consisted of nine ensemble members, and covered the period 1969--2001. The ensemble was generated by only varying atmospheric initial conditions, which were sampled from the initialization run to capture intraseasonal variability. At six-month lead, the model is able to capture all the major ENSO extremes of the period. However, because of poor sampling of ocean initial conditions and model deficiencies, the ensemble-mean anomaly correlation skill for Ni{\~n}o3 SST is only 0.6 at six-month lead. None the less, the results presented here demonstrate the potential of such a simple scheme, and provide a simple method by which SST information may be better used in more complex initialization schemes.},

	Abstract = {The {``Vertical} structure and physical processes of the {Madden-Julian} oscillation {(MJO)''} project comprises three experiments, designed to evaluate comprehensively the heating, moistening, and momentum associated with tropical convection in general circulation models {(GCMs).} We consider here only those {GCMs} that performed all experiments. Some models display relatively higher or lower {MJO} fidelity in both initialized hindcasts and climate simulations, while others show considerable variations in fidelity between experiments. Fidelity in hindcasts and climate simulations are not meaningfully correlated. The analysis of each experiment led to the development of process-oriented diagnostics, some of which distinguished between {GCMs} with higher or lower fidelity in that experiment. We select the most discriminating diagnostics and apply them to data from all experiments, where possible, to determine if correlations with {MJO} fidelity hold across scales and {GCM} states. While normalized gross moist stability had a small but statistically significant correlation with {MJO} fidelity in climate simulations, we find no link with fidelity in medium-range hindcasts. Similarly, there is no association between time step to time step rainfall variability, identified from short hindcasts and fidelity in medium-range hindcasts or climate simulations. Two metrics that relate precipitation to free-tropospheric moisture---the relative humidity for extreme daily precipitation and variations in the height and amplitude of moistening with rain rate---successfully distinguish between higher-fidelity and lower fidelity {GCMs} in hindcasts and climate simulations. To improve the {MJO,} developers should focus on relationships between convection and both total moisture and its rate of change. We conclude by offering recommendations for further experiments.},

	Abstract = {The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) version 5 includes a spectral element dynamical core option from NCAR's High-Order Method Modeling Environment. It is a continuous Galerkin spectral finite-element method designed for fully unstructured quadrilateral meshes. The current configurations in CAM are based on the cubed-sphere grid. The main motivation for including a spectral element dynamical core is to improve the scalability of CAM by allowing quasi-uniform grids for the sphere that do not require polar filters. In addition, the approach provides other state-of-the-art capabilities such as improved conservation properties. Spectral elements are used for the horizontal discretization, while most other aspects of the dynamical core are a hybrid of well-tested techniques from CAM's finite volume and global spectral dynamical core options. Here we first give an overview of the spectral element dynamical core as used in CAM. We then give scalability and performance results from CAM running with three different dynamical core options within the Community Earth System Model, using a pre-industrial time-slice configuration. We focus on high-resolution simulations, using 1/4 degree, 1/8 degree, and T341 spectral truncation horizontal grids.},

This is the first step in evaluating the suitability of spectral elements for climate modeling. The potential advantages and disadvantages of spectral elements over more conventional models used for climate studies are discussed. The method requires that the sphere be tiled with rectangles, for which we make use of the gnomonic projection to map the sphere onto the cube. To measure the performance of the method relative to other models, results are presented from a standard suite of shallow water test cases for the sphere.

The vertically Lagrangian discretization reduces the dimensionality of the physical problem from three to two with the resulting dynamical system closely resembling that of the shallow water system. The 2D horizontal-to-Lagrangian-surface transport and dynamical processes are then discretized using the genuinely conservative flux-form semi-Lagrangian algorithm. Time marching is split-explicit, with large time steps for scalar transport, and small fractional steps for the Lagrangian dynamics, which permits the accurate propagation of fast waves. A mass, momentum, and total energy conserving algorithm is developed for remapping the state variables periodically from the floating Lagrangian control-volume to an Eulerian terrain-following coordinate for dealing with ?physical parameterizations? and to prevent severe distortion of the Lagrangian surfaces. Deterministic baroclinic wave-growth tests and long-term integrations using the Held?Suarez forcing are presented. Impact of the monotonicity constraint is discussed.},

The vertically Lagrangian discretization reduces the dimensionality of the physical problem from three to two with the resulting dynamical system closely resembling that of the shallow water system. The 2D horizontal-to-Lagrangian-surface transport and dynamical processes are then discretized using the genuinely conservative flux-form semi-Lagrangian algorithm. Time marching is split-explicit, with large time steps for scalar transport, and small fractional steps for the Lagrangian dynamics, which permits the accurate propagation of fast waves. A mass, momentum, and total energy conserving algorithm is developed for remapping the state variables periodically from the floating Lagrangian control-volume to an Eulerian terrain-following coordinate for dealing with ?physical parameterizations? and to prevent severe distortion of the Lagrangian surfaces. Deterministic baroclinic wave-growth tests and long-term integrations using the Held?Suarez forcing are presented. Impact of the monotonicity constraint is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Abstract A low-resolution coupled ocean?atmosphere general circulation model (OAGCM) is used to study the characteristics of the large-scale ocean circulation and its climatic impacts in a series of global coupled aquaplanet experiments. Three configurations, designed to produce fundamentally different ocean circulation regimes, are considered. The first has no obstruction to zonal flow, the second contains a low barrier that blocks zonal flow in the ocean at all latitudes, creating a single enclosed basin, while the third contains a gap in the barrier to allow circumglobal flow at high southern latitudes. Warm greenhouse climates with a global average air surface temperature of around 27$\,^{\circ}$C result in all cases. Equator-to-pole temperature gradients are shallower than that of a current climate simulation. While changes in the land configuration cause regional changes in temperature, winds, and rainfall, heat transports within the system are little affected. Inhibition of all ocean transport on the aquaplanet leads to a reduction in global mean surface temperature of 8$\,^{\circ}$C, along with a sharpening of the meridional temperature gradient. This results from a reduction in global atmospheric water vapor content and an increase in tropical albedo, both of which act to reduce global surface temperatures. Fitting a simple radiative model to the atmospheric characteristics of the OAGCM solutions suggests that a simpler atmosphere model, with radiative parameters chosen a priori based on the changing surface configuration, would have produced qualitatively different results.

	Abstract = {The convergence of simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model with increasing resolution is determined in an aqua-planet context. Convergence as a function of scale is considered. Horizontal resolution (T42--T340) and time step (40--5 min) are varied separately. The simulations are sensitive to both. Global averages do not necessarily converge with increasing resolution. The zonal average equatorial precipitation shows a strong sensitivity to time step. Parametrizations should be applied in a range of time steps where such sensitivity is not seen. The larger scales of the zonal average equatorial precipitation converge with increasing resolution. There is a mass shift from polar to equatorial regions with increasing resolution with no indication of convergence. The zonal average cloud fraction decreases with increasing resolution with no indication of convergence. Equatorial wave propagation characteristics converge with increasing resolution, however a relatively high truncation of T170 is required to capture wavenumbers less than 16. Extremes are studied in the form of the probability density functions of precipitation. The largest half of the scales of the model converge for resolutions above T85.},

	Abstract = {Cloud feedbacks are a leading source of uncertainty in the climate sensitivity simulated by global climate models (GCMs). Low-latitude boundary-layer and cumulus cloud regimes are particularly problematic, because they are sustained by tight interactions between clouds and unresolved turbulent circulations. Turbulence-resolving models better simulate such cloud regimes and support the GCM consensus that they contribute to positive global cloud feedbacks. Large-eddy simulations using sub-100 m grid spacings over small computational domains elucidate marine boundary-layer cloud response to greenhouse warming. Four observationally supported mechanisms contribute: {\textquoteleft}thermodynamic{\textquoteright} cloudiness reduction from warming of the atmosphere{\textendash}ocean column, {\textquoteleft}radiative{\textquoteright} cloudiness reduction from CO2- and H2O-induced increase in atmospheric emissivity aloft, {\textquoteleft}stability-induced{\textquoteright} cloud increase from increased lower tropospheric stratification, and {\textquoteleft}dynamical{\textquoteright} cloudiness increase from reduced subsidence. The cloudiness reduction mechanisms typically dominate, giving positive shortwave cloud feedback. Cloud-resolving models with horizontal grid spacings of a few kilometres illuminate how cumulonimbus cloud systems affect climate feedbacks. Limited-area simulations and superparameterized GCMs show upward shift and slight reduction of cloud cover in a warmer climate, implying positive cloud feedbacks. A global cloud-resolving model suggests tropical cirrus increases in a warmer climate, producing positive longwave cloud feedback, but results are sensitive to subgrid turbulence and ice microphysics schemes.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Numerical experiments are described that pertain to the climate of a coupled atmosphere?ocean?ice system in the absence of land, driven by modern-day orbital and CO2 forcing. Millennial time-scale simulations yield a mean state in which ice caps reach down to 55$\,^{\circ}$of latitude and both the atmosphere and ocean comprise eastward- and westward-flowing zonal jets, whose structure is set by their respective baroclinic instabilities. Despite the zonality of the ocean, it is remarkably efficient at transporting heat meridionally through the agency of Ekman transport and eddy-driven subduction. Indeed the partition of heat transport between the atmosphere and ocean is much the same as the present climate, with the ocean dominating in the Tropics and the atmosphere in the mid?high latitudes. Variability of the system is dominated by the coupling of annular modes in the atmosphere and ocean. Stochastic variability inherent to the atmospheric jets drives variability in the ocean. Zonal flows in the ocean exhibit decadal variability, which, remarkably, feeds back to the atmosphere, coloring the spectrum of annular variability. A simple stochastic model can capture the essence of the process.

Millennial time-scale simulations yield a mean state in which ice caps reach down to 55$\,^{\circ}$of latitude and both the atmosphere and ocean comprise eastward- and westward-flowing zonal jets, whose structure is set by their respective baroclinic instabilities. Despite the zonality of the ocean, it is remarkably efficient at transporting heat meridionally through the agency of Ekman transport and eddy-driven subduction. Indeed the partition of heat transport between the atmosphere and ocean is much the same as the present climate, with the ocean dominating in the Tropics and the atmosphere in the mid?high latitudes. Variability of the system is dominated by the coupling of annular modes in the atmosphere and ocean. Stochastic variability inherent to the atmospheric jets drives variability in the ocean. Zonal flows in the ocean exhibit decadal variability, which, remarkably, feeds back to the atmosphere, coloring the spectrum of annular variability. A simple stochastic model can capture the essence of the process. Finally, it is briefly reviewed how the aquaplanet can provide information about the processes that set the partition of heat transport and the climate of Earth.},

	Abstract = {Summary Wetlands are vital habitats and can be used as landscape indicators because they integrate catchment-scale processes. Wetland drying during the recent decades in Yellowstone National Park's Northern Range has incited concern among National Park managers and the public at large. Our research was focused on developing an understanding of the processes controlling wetland water levels and the changes contributing to wetland decline in the Northern Range. We integrated analyses of hydrology, climate, soils, and vegetation. In 2009, 24 study wetlands were instrumented each with an average of five shallow groundwater monitoring well and piezometer nests. We mapped hydric soils, analyzed aerial photographs, and identified geomorphic indicators of higher water to quantify historic wetland area. The Trumpeter Lake study site was intensively studied to resolve watershed processes driving water table changes through time, and it was used to identify the timescale on which a regionally critical wetland varies. Climate data indicated that warming and drying occurred during the last century, but that this pattern was within the natural range of variation for the study region over the past 800 years, as determined from tree ring data. Hydrologic data revealed that study sites included locations of groundwater discharge, recharge, and flow-through as well as water perched above the regional water table. Hydrologic regimes were classified using a shape-magnitude framework and seven wetland classes were characterized, and the robustness of this classification is assessed using longer-term datasets. Aerial photographs and hydric soil delineation both confirmed formerly greater wetland abundance. Changes varied by wetland class and the presence or absence of surface water outlets. Wetland plant species inhabited distinct habitats of water table depth and variation, and can be used to infer subsurface hydrologic regime in the absence of extensive monitoring well networks. A subset of long-term monitoring wells has been instrumented with groundwater pressure transducers, enabling further understanding of wetland hydrologic processes, promoting additional assessment of the wetland classification, and aiding in identification of wetlands especially vulnerable to climate change. },

	Abstract = {Climate change is likely to alter wildfire regimes, but the magnitude and timing of potential climate-driven changes in regional fire regimes are not well understood. We considered how the occurrence, size, and spatial location of large fires might respond to climate projections in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem (GYE) (Wyoming), a large wildland ecosystem dominated by conifer forests and characterized by infrequent, high-severity fire. We developed a suite of statistical models that related monthly climate data (1972--1999) to the occurrence and size of fires >200 ha in the northern Rocky Mountains; these models were cross-validated and then used with downscaled (∼12 km ×12 km) climate projections from three global climate models to predict fire occurrence and area burned in the GYE through 2099. All models predicted substantial increases in fire by midcentury, with fire rotation (the time to burn an area equal to the landscape area) reduced to <30 y from the historical 100--300 y for most of the GYE. Years without large fires were common historically but are expected to become rare as annual area burned and the frequency of regionally synchronous fires increase. Our findings suggest a shift to novel fire--climate--vegetation relationships in Greater Yellowstone by midcentury because fire frequency and extent would be inconsistent with persistence of the current suite of conifer species. The predicted new fire regime would transform the flora, fauna, and ecosystem processes in this landscape and may indicate similar changes for other subalpine forests.},

The low-level wind speed in CAM5 is about half as strong as in CAM4, and the difference is even larger in areas where the subgrid-scale terrain is significant.

	Abstract = {AbstractPrognostic precipitation is added to a cloud microphysical scheme for global climate models. Results indicate very similar performance to other commonly used mesoscale schemes in an offline driver for idealized warm rain cases, better than the previous version of the global model microphysics scheme with diagnostic precipitation. In the mixed phase regime, there is significantly more water and less ice, which may address a common bias seen with the scheme in climate simulations in the Arctic. For steady forcing cases, the scheme has limited sensitivity to time step out to the \~{}15-min time steps typical of global models. The scheme is similar to other schemes with moderate sensitivity to vertical resolution. The limited time step sensitivity bodes well for use of the scheme in multiscale models from the mesoscale to the large scale. The scheme is sensitive to idealized perturbations of cloud drop and crystal number. Precipitation decreases and condensate increases with increasing drop number, indicating substantial decreases in precipitation efficiency. The sensitivity is less than with the previous version of the scheme for low drop number concentrations (Nc < 100 cm?3). Ice condensate increases with ice number, with large decreases in liquid condensate as well for a mixed phase case.

Results indicate very similar performance to other commonly used mesoscale schemes in an offline driver for idealized warm rain cases, better than the previous version of the global model microphysics scheme with diagnostic precipitation. In the mixed phase regime, there is significantly more water and less ice, which may address a common bias seen with the scheme in climate simulations in the Arctic. For steady forcing cases, the scheme has limited sensitivity to time step out to the \~{}15-min time steps typical of global models. The scheme is similar to other schemes with moderate sensitivity to vertical resolution. The limited time step sensitivity bodes well for use of the scheme in multiscale models from the mesoscale to the large scale. The scheme is sensitive to idealized perturbations of cloud drop and crystal number. Precipitation decreases and condensate increases with increasing drop number, indicating substantial decreases in precipitation efficiency. The sensitivity is less than with the previous version of the scheme for low drop number concentrations (Nc < 100 cm?3). Ice condensate increases with ice number, with large decreases in liquid condensate as well for a mixed phase case. As expected with prognostic precipitation, accretion is stronger than with diagnostic precipitation and the accretion to autoconversion ratio increases faster with liquid water path (LWP), in better agreement with idealized models and earlier studies than the previous version.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Teleconnections have traditionally been studied for the case of dry dynamical response to a given diabatic heat source. Important anomalies often occur within convective zones, for instance, in the observed remote response to El Ni{\~n}o. The reduction of rainfall and teleconnection propagation in deep convective regions poses theoretical challenges because feedbacks involving convective heating and cloud radiative effects come into play. Land surface feedbacks, including variations of land surface temperature, and ocean surface layer temperature response must be taken into account. During El Ni{\~n}o, descent and negative precipitation anomalies often extend across equatorial South America and the Atlantic intertropical convergence zone. Analysis of simulated mechanisms in a case study of the 1997/98 El Ni{\~n}o is used to illustrate the general principals of teleconnections occurring in deep convective zones, contrasting land and ocean regions. Comparison to other simulated events shows similar behavior. Tropospheric temperature and wind anomalies are spread eastward by wave dynamics modified by interaction with the moist convection zones. The traditional picture would have gradual descent balanced by radiative damping, but this scenario misses the most important balances in the moist static energy (MSE) budget. A small ?zoo? of mechanisms is active in producing strong regional descent anomalies and associated drought. Factors common to several mechanisms include the role of convective quasi equilibrium (QE) in linking low-level moisture anomalies to free tropospheric temperature anomalies in a two-way interaction referred to as QE mediation. Convective heating feedbacks change the net static stability to a gross moist stability (GMS) M. The large cloud radiative feedback terms may be manipulated to appear as a modified static stability Meff, under approximations that are quantified for the quasi-equilibrium tropical circulation model used here. The relevant measure of Meff differs between land, where surface energy flux balance applies, and short time scales over ocean. For the time scale of an onsetting El Ni{\~n}o, a mixed layer ocean response is similar to a fixed sea surface temperature (SST) case, with surface fluxes lost into the ocean and Meff substantially reduced over ocean-enhancing descent anomalies. Use of Meff aids analysis of terms that act as the initiators of descent anomalies. Apparently modest terms in the MSE budget can be acted on by the GMS multiplier effect, which yields substantial precipitation anomalies due to the large ratio of the moisture convergence to the MSE divergence. Advection terms enter in several mechanisms, with the leading effects here due to advection by mean winds in both MSE and momentum balances. A Kelvinoid solution is presented as a prototype for how easterly flow enhances moist wave decay mechanisms, permitting relatively small damping terms by surface drag and radiative damping to produce the substantial eastward temperature gradients seen in observations and simulations and contributing to precipitation anomalies. The leading mechanism for drought in eastern equatorial South America is the upped-ante mechanism in which QE mediation of teleconnected tropospheric temperature anomalies tends to produce moisture gradients between the convection zone, where low-level moisture increases toward QE, and the neighboring nonconvective region. Over the Atlantic ITCZ, the upped-ante mechanism is a substantial contributor, but on short time scales several mechanisms referred to jointly as troposphere/SST disequilibrium mechanisms are important. While SST is adjusting during passive SST (coupled ocean mixed layer) experiments, or for fixed SST, heat flux to the ocean is lost to the atmosphere, and these mechanisms can induce descent and precipitation anomalies, although they disappear when SST equilibrates. In simulations here, cloud radiative feedbacks, surface heat fluxes induced by teleconnected wind anomalies, and surface fluxes induced by QE-mediated temperature anomalies are significant disequilibrium contributors. At time scales of several months or longer, remaining Atlantic ITCZ rainfall reductions are maintained by the upped-ante mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Two new filtering/diffusion operators have been implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model finite-volume dynamical core (CAM-FV). First, a fourth-order divergence damping operator has been added to optionally replace the second-order version that has traditionally been used. This provides more scale selective dissipation of divergent modes that can generate grid-scale noise in CAM-FV if not damped properly. For example, data assimilation runs using CAM-FV DART (Data Assimilation Research Testbed) have revealed potential noise problems at the grid scale that can be alleviated significantly using higher-order divergence damping. Second, a `Laplacian'-type damping operator has been implemented to increase the explicit momentum dissipation in the top-of-atmosphere sponge layers. This helps control the excessive polar night jets that have been observed in ultra-high-resolution CAM-FV simulations. Results from stand-alone CAM-FV and CAM-FV DART are presented in this paper along with details on the implementation of the new operators.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThe extratropical eddy momentum flux (EMF) is controlled by generation, propagation, and dissipation of large-scale eddies and is concentrated in Earth?s upper troposphere. An idealized GCM is used to investigate how this EMF structure arises. In simulations in which the poles are heated more strongly than the equator, EMF is concentrated near the surface, demonstrating that surface drag generally is not responsible for the upper-tropospheric EMF concentration. Although Earth?s upper troposphere favors linear wave propagation, quasi-linear simulations in which nonlinear eddy?eddy interactions are suppressed demonstrate that this is likewise not primarily responsible for the upper-tropospheric EMF concentration. The quasi-linear simulations reveal the essential role of nonlinear eddy?eddy interactions in the surf zone in the upper troposphere, where wave activity absorption away from the baroclinic generation regions occurs through the nonlinear generation of small scales.

An idealized GCM is used to investigate how this EMF structure arises. In simulations in which the poles are heated more strongly than the equator, EMF is concentrated near the surface, demonstrating that surface drag generally is not responsible for the upper-tropospheric EMF concentration. Although Earth?s upper troposphere favors linear wave propagation, quasi-linear simulations in which nonlinear eddy?eddy interactions are suppressed demonstrate that this is likewise not primarily responsible for the upper-tropospheric EMF concentration. The quasi-linear simulations reveal the essential role of nonlinear eddy?eddy interactions in the surf zone in the upper troposphere, where wave activity absorption away from the baroclinic generation regions occurs through the nonlinear generation of small scales. In Earth-like atmospheres, wave activity that is generated in the lower troposphere propagates upward and then turns meridionally, eventually being absorbed nonlinearly in the upper troposphere. The level at which the wave activity begins to propagate meridionally appears to be set by the typical height reached by baroclinic eddies.

For this purpose all models were required to simulate the evolution of the climate during the decade 1979?88, subject to the observed monthly average temperature and sea ice and a common prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentration and solar constant. By 1995, 31 modeling groups, representing virtually the entire international atmospheric modeling community, had contributed the required standard output of the monthly means of selected statistics. These data have been analyzed by the participating modeling groups, by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, and by the more than two dozen AMIP diagnostic subprojects that have been established to examine specific aspects of the models' performance. Here the analysis and validation of the AMIP results as a whole are summarized in order to document the overall performance of atmospheric general circulation?climate models as of the early 1990s. The infrastructure and plans for continuation of the AMIP project are also reported on. Although there are apparent model outliers in each simulated variable examined, validation of the AMIP models' ensemble mean shows that the average large-scale seasonal distributions of pressure, temperature, and circulation are reasonably close to what are believed to be the best observational estimates available. The large-scale structure of the ensemble mean precipitation and ocean surface heat flux also resemble the observed estimates but show particularly large intermodel differences in low latitudes. The total cloudiness, on the other hand, is rather poorly simulated, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. The models' simulation of the seasonal cycle (as represented by the amplitude and phase of the first annual harmonic of sea level pressure) closely resembles the observed variation in almost all regions.

When analyzed in terms of the variability of the evolution of their combined space-time patterns in comparison to observations, the AMIP models are seen to exhibit a wide range of accuracy, with no single model performing best in all respects considered. Analysis of the subset of the original AMIP models for which revised versions have subsequently been used to revisit the experiment shows a substantial reduction of the models' systematic errors in simulating cloudiness but only a slight reduction of the mean seasonal errors of most other variables.

	Abstract = {AbstractThe Community Atmosphere Model, version 4 (CAM4), was released as part of the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). The finite volume (FV) dynamical core is now the default because of its superior transport and conservation properties. Deep convection parameterization changes include a dilute plume calculation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the introduction of convective momentum transport (CMT). An additional cloud fraction calculation is now performed following macrophysical state updates to provide improved thermodynamic consistency. A freeze-drying modification is further made to the cloud fraction calculation in very dry environments (e.g., the Arctic), where cloud fraction and cloud water values were often inconsistent in CAM3. In CAM4 the FV dynamical core further degrades the excessive trade-wind simulation, but reduces zonal stress errors at higher latitudes. Plume dilution alleviates much of the midtropospheric tropical dry biases and reduces the persistent monsoon precipitation biases over the Arabian Peninsula and the southern Indian Ocean. CMT reduces much of the excessive trade-wind biases in eastern ocean basins. CAM4 shows a global reduction in cloud fraction compared to CAM3, primarily as a result of the freeze-drying and improved cloud fraction equilibrium modifications. Regional climate feature improvements include the propagation of stationary waves from the Pacific into midlatitudes and the seasonal frequency of Northern Hemisphere blocking events. A 1$\,^{\circ}$versus 2$\,^{\circ}$horizontal resolution of the FV dynamical core exhibits superior improvements in regional climate features of precipitation and surface stress. Improvements in the fully coupled mean climate between CAM3 and CAM4 are also more substantial than in forced sea surface temperature (SST) simulations.},

	N2 = {AbstractThe Community Atmosphere Model, version 4 (CAM4), was released as part of the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). The finite volume (FV) dynamical core is now the default because of its superior transport and conservation properties. Deep convection parameterization changes include a dilute plume calculation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the introduction of convective momentum transport (CMT). An additional cloud fraction calculation is now performed following macrophysical state updates to provide improved thermodynamic consistency. A freeze-drying modification is further made to the cloud fraction calculation in very dry environments (e.g., the Arctic), where cloud fraction and cloud water values were often inconsistent in CAM3. In CAM4 the FV dynamical core further degrades the excessive trade-wind simulation, but reduces zonal stress errors at higher latitudes. Plume dilution alleviates much of the midtropospheric tropical dry biases and reduces the persistent monsoon precipitation biases over the Arabian Peninsula and the southern Indian Ocean. CMT reduces much of the excessive trade-wind biases in eastern ocean basins. CAM4 shows a global reduction in cloud fraction compared to CAM3, primarily as a result of the freeze-drying and improved cloud fraction equilibrium modifications. Regional climate feature improvements include the propagation of stationary waves from the Pacific into midlatitudes and the seasonal frequency of Northern Hemisphere blocking events. A 1$\,^{\circ}$versus 2$\,^{\circ}$horizontal resolution of the FV dynamical core exhibits superior improvements in regional climate features of precipitation and surface stress. Improvements in the fully coupled mean climate between CAM3 and CAM4 are also more substantial than in forced sea surface temperature (SST) simulations.},

	Abstract = {ERA-Interim represents a major undertaking by ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) to produce a reanalysis with an improved atmospheric model and assimilation system which replaces those used in ERA-40, particularly for the data-rich 1990s and 2000s, and to be continued as an ECMWF Climate Data Assimilation System (ECDAS) until superseded by a new extended reanalysis. Preliminary runs indicated that several of the inaccuracies exhibited by ERA-40 such as too-strong precipitation over oceans from the early 1990s onwards and a too-strong Brewer-Dobson circulation in the stratosphere, were eliminated or significantly reduced. Production of ERA-Interim, from 1989 onwards, began in summer of 2006. (The period 1979-1988 was prepended in 2011.)  Through systematic increases of computing power, 4-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) became feasible and part of ECMWF operations since 1997, paving the way to base ERA-Interim on 4D-Var (rather than 3D-Var as in ERA-40). Enhanced computing power also allowed horizontal resolution to be increased from T159 (N80, nominally 1.125 degrees for ERA-40) to T255 (N128, nominally 0.703125 degrees), and the latest cycle of the atmospheric model (IFS CY31r1 and CY31r2) to be used, taking advantage of improved model physics. ERA-interim retains the same 60 model levels used for ERA-40 with the highest level being 0.1 hectopascal. In addition, data assimilation of ERA-Interim also benefits from quality control that draws on experience from ERA-40 and JRA-25, variational bias correction of satellite radiance data, and more extensive use of radiances with an improved fast radiative transfer model.  ERA-Interim uses sets of observations and boundary forcing fields acquired for ERA-40 through 2001, and from ECMWF operations thereafter. Noteworthy exceptions include new ERS (European Remote Sensing Satellite) altimeter wave heights, EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) reprocessed winds and clear-sky radiances, GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment) ozone data from the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, and CHAMP (CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload), GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment), and COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate) GPS radio occultation measurements processed and archived by UCAR (University Corporation for Atmospheric Research).  NCAR's Data Support Section (DSS) is performing and supplying a grid transformed version of ERA-Interim, in which variables originally represented as spectral coefficients or archived on a reduced Gaussian grid are transformed to a regular 512 longitude by 256 latitude N128 Gaussian grid. In addition, DSS is also computing horizontal winds (u-component, v-component) from spectral vorticity and divergence where these are available. Processing of analysis groups and the surface forecast has been completed for January 1979 through December 2012 (inclusive), or at least 34 years, and will continue as ERA-Interim becomes available thereafter. Data is currently available via NCAR's High Performance Storage System (HPSS), or by delayed mode request which transfers files from the HPSS to our web server for internet download, or via direct internet download, or NCAR's GLADE file system.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Single column models (SCMs) provide an economical framework for developing and diagnosing representations of diabatic processes in weather and climate models. Their economy is achieved at the price of ignoring interactions with the circulation dynamics and with neighboring columns. It has recently been emphasized that this decoupling can lead to spurious error growth in SCM integrations that can totally obscure the error growth due to errors in the column physics that one hopes to isolate through such integrations. This paper suggests one way around this ?existential crisis? of single column modeling. The basic idea is to focus on short-term SCM forecast errors, at ranges of 6 h or less, before a grossly unrealistic model state develops and before complex diabatic interactions render a clear diagnosis impossible. To illustrate, a short-term forecast error diagnosis of the NCAR SCM is presented for tropical conditions observed during the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Coupled Ocean?Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE). The 21-day observing period is divided into 84 6-h segments for this purpose. The SCM error evolution is shown to be nearly linear over these 6-h segments and, indeed, apart from a vertical mean bias, to be mainly an extrapolation of initial tendencies. The latter are then decomposed into contributions by various components of the column physics, and additional 6-h integrations are performed with each component separately and in combination with others to assess its contribution to the 6-h errors. Initial tendency and 6-h error diagnostics thus complement each other in diagnosing column physics errors by this approach. Although the SCM evolution from one time step to the next is nearly linear, the finite-amplitude adjustments made multiple times within each time step to the temperature and humidity to remove supersaturation and convective instabilities make it necessary to consider nonlinear interactions between the column physics components. One such particularly strong interaction is identified between vertical diffusion and deep convection. The former, though nominally small, is shown to have a profound impact on both the amplitude and timing of the latter, and thence on the small imbalance between the total diabatic heating and adiabatic cooling of ascent in the column. The SCM diagnosis thus suggests that misrepresentation of this interaction, in addition to that of the interacting components themselves, might be a major contributor to the NCAR GCM's tropical simulation errors.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud System Study (GCSS) was organized to promote the development of improved parameterizations of cloud systems for use in climate and numerical weather prediction models, with an emphasis on the climate applications. GCSS uses models to analyze and understand observations of the behavior of cloud systems. Cloud-system-resolving models (CSRMs) have sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to represent individual cloud elements, but cover a wide enough range of time and space scales to permit statistical analysis of simulated cloud systems. Results from CSRMs are compared with detailed observations, representing specific cases based on field experiments, and also with statistical composites obtained from satellite and meteorological analyses. Single-column models (SCMs) are the column physics components of atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs). SCMs are used to test cloud parameterizations in an uncoupled mode, by comparison with field data and statistical composites. In the original GCSS strategy, data are collected in various field programs and provided to the CSRM community, which first uses the data to ?certify? the CSRMs as reliable tools for the simulation of particular cloud regimes, and then uses the CSRMs to develop parameterizations, which are provided to the GCM community. Results of a rethinking of the scientific strategy of GCSS, which takes into account the practical issues that arise in confronting models with data, are reported on herein. The main elements of the proposed new strategy are a more active role for the large-scale modeling community, an explicit recognition of the importance of data integration, and an increasing use of observed cloud-scale statistics for model evaluations.},

	Abstract = {Fundamental puzzles of climate science remain unsolved because of our limited understanding of how clouds, circulation and climate interact. One example is our inability to provide robust assessments of future global and regional climate changes. However, ongoing advances in our capacity to observe, simulate and conceptualize the climate system now make it possible to fill gaps in our knowledge. We argue that progress can be accelerated by focusing research on a handful of important scientific questions that have become tractable as a result of recent advances. We propose four such questions below; they involve understanding the role of cloud feedbacks and convective organization in climate, and the factors that control the position, the strength and the variability of the tropical rain belts and the extratropical storm tracks.},

This paper investigates the effect of mesh refinement in a climate model by running variable-resolution (var-res) simulations on an aquaplanet.

Global cloud fraction decreases and equatorial precipitation increases with finer horizontal resolution, resulting in drastically different climates between the uniform grid runs and a physics-induced grid imprinting in the var-res simulation. Using CAM version 5 (CAM5) physics significantly improves cloud scaling at different grid resolutions. Additional precipitation at the equator in the high-resolution mesh results in collocated zonally anomalous divergence in both var-res simulations, although this feature is much weaker in CAM5 than CAM4. The equilibrium solution at each grid spacing within the var-res simulations captures the majority of the resolution signal of the corresponding globally uniform grids. The var-res simulation exhibits good performance with respect to wave propagation, including equatorial regions where waves pass through grid transitions.

	Abstract = {Abstract Despite recent improvements in satellite instrument calibration and the algorithms used to determine reflected solar (SW) and emitted thermal (LW) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes, a sizeable imbalance persists in the average global net radiation at the TOA from satellite observations.

@article{Reed:2015,
	Abstract = {AbstractIn the continued effort to understand the climate system and improve its representation in atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs), it is crucial to develop reduced complexity frameworks to evaluate these models. This is especially true as the AGCM community advances towards high horizontal resolutions (i.e., grid spacing less than 50 km), which will require interpreting and improving the performance of many model components.

	Abstract = {Abstract Radiative forcing and latent heat associated with precipitation are the two most important diabatic processes that drive the circulation of the atmosphere. Clouds can affect radiation and vice versa. It is known that longwave radiative processes can enhance precipitation in cloud systems. This paper concentrates on determining the relative importance of three specific longwave radiative mechanisms by comparing cloud-resolving models with and without one or more of these processes. Three of the ways that longwave radiation is thought to interact with clouds are as follows: 1) cloud-top cooling and cloud-base warming may alter the thermal stratification of cloud layers, 2) differential cooling between clear and cloudy regions might enhance convergence into the cloud system, and 3) large-scale cooling could change the environment. A two-dimensional version of the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model has been used to perform a series of sensitivity tests to identify which is the dominant cloud-radiative forcing mechanism with respect to the organization, structure, and precipitation processes for both a tropical (EMEX) and a midlatitude (PRE-STORM) mesoscale convective system. The model results indicate that the dominant process for enhancing the surface precipitation in both the PRE-STORM and EMEX squall cases is the large-scale radiative cooling. However, the overall effect is really to increase the relative humidity and not tie convective available potential energy (CAPE). Because of the high moisture in the Tropics, the increase in relative humidity by radiative cooling can have more of an impact on precipitation in the tropical case than in the midlatitude case. The large-scale cooling led to a 36{\%} increase in rainfall for the tropical cast. The midlatitude model squall with a higher CAPE and lower humidity environment was only slightly affected (8{\%}) by any of the longwave mechanisms. Our results also indicated that the squall systems' overall (convective and stratiform) precipitation is increased by turning off the cloud-top cooling and cloud-base warming. Therefore, the cloud-top cooling-cloud-base warming mechanism was not the responsible cloud-radiative mechanism for enhancing the surface precipitation. However, the circulation as well as the microphysical processes were indeed (slightly) enhanced in the stratiform region by the cloud-top cooling and cloud-base warming mechanism for the midlatitude squall case. For both cases, the model results show that the mechanism associated with differential cooling between the clear and cloudy regions may or may not enhance precipitation processes. However, this mechanism is definitely less important than the large-scale longwave radiative cooling. Solar heating was run from 0900 to 1300 LST in both environments and was found to decrease the precipitation by 7{\%} in each case compared to the runs with longwave radiation only. This result suggests that solar heating may play a significant role in the daytime minimum/nighttime maximum precipitation cycle found over most oceans.},

Afternoon rainfall comes mostly from convective cells, but the nocturnal rainfall is derived from deeper convective cells and large areas of stratiform clouds. Results further show that afternoon convective showers are more evident in the large-scale undisturbed periods when the diurnal SST cycle is strong, but the nocturnal convective systems and morning cumulus are more enhanced in the disturbed periods when more moisture is available.

	Abstract = {Abstract This paper presents an analysis of the diurnal variation of tropical oceanic convection and its associated energy cycle as simulated by an anelastic cumulus ensemble model. The model includes subgrid turbulence, cloud microphysics, and radiative transfer processes. In two experiments designed to simulate the diurnal cycles in large-scale disturbed (A1) and undisturbed conditions (A4) over the tropical western Pacific warm pool, the model produces diurnal variations that are in general agreement with observations. In A1, a time-independent SST and mean ascending motion are prescribed in the model. The model generates a diurnal cycle with positive (negative) rainfall anomalies during the night (day), and the maximum (minimum) rainfall near 0200 (1300?1400) local time. In A4, a diurnally varying SST is prescribed in the model and the domain-averaged vertical velocity is constrained to be zero. The simulated diurnal variations still have a nocturnal rainfall maximum but with a weaker magnitude and a secondary peak in the afternoon. The model is then used to investigate the radiative effects of clouds that has been suggested as the cause of the nocturnal rainfall maximum by many studies. Two experiments (A2 and A3) are performed with the model, in which a time-independent SST is prescribed and the domain-averaged vertical velocity is constrained to be zero. The only difference between the two experiments is that the cloud?radiation interaction is suppressed in A3. The results show that despite the significant difference in total cloudiness/rainfall due to the difference in mean vertical motion between A2 and A1, and the difference in cloud?radiative forcing between A2 and A3, the simulated diurnal cycles in all three experiments show a dominant nocturnal rainfall maximum.

	Abstract = {Abstract This study analyzes the diurnal cycle of precipitation simulated in a global cloud-resolving model (GCRM) named the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM). A 30-day integration of NICAM successfully simulates the precipitation diurnal cycle associated with the land?sea breeze and the thermally induced topographic circulations as well as the horizontal propagation of diurnal cycle signals. The first harmonic of the diurnal cycle of precipitation in the 7-km run agrees well with that from satellite observations in its geographical distributions although its amplitude is slightly overestimated. The NICAM simulation revealed that the precipitation diurnal cycle over the Maritime Continent is strongly coupled with the land?sea breeze that controls the convergence/divergence pattern in the lower troposphere around the islands. The analysis also suggests that the cold pool often forms over the open ocean where the precipitation intensity is high, and the propagation of the cold pool events is related to the precipitation diurnal cycle as well as the land?sea breeze. Sensitivity experiments suggest a prominent horizontal resolution dependence of the simulated precipitation diurnal cycle. Over continental areas the 14-km run induces the diurnal peak about three hours later than the 7-km run. The 3.5-km run produces the peak time and amplitude that are very similar to those in Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation radar (PR) observations. Meanwhile, the resolution dependence in phase and amplitude is negligibly small over the open oceans. This contrast sensitivity to the horizontal resolution is attributed to the differences in structure and life cycle of convective systems over land and ocean. Diurnal peaks of precipitable water vapor, precipitation, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) are compared over land areas using the NICAM 7-km run. The daily precipitable water vapor maximum appears around 1500 local time (LT), which is followed by the precipitation peak around 1630 LT. The diurnal cycle of high clouds tends to peak around 1930 LT, three hours later than the precipitation peak. These results from NICAM simulations can explain the cause of the phase differences among precipitation products based on several satellite observations. The authors demonstrate that the GCRM is a promising tool for realistically simulating the precipitation diurnal cycle and could be quite useful for studying the role of the diurnal cycle in the climate systems in a global context.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the circulations driven by deep heating and shallow heating are investigated through analytically solving a set of linear equations and examining circulations simulated by a dry primitive equation model. Special emphasis is placed on the low-level mass (moisture) convergence associated with the forced circulation and the maintenance of the shallow and deep heat sources. It is found that the forced circulation driven by shallow heating is more likely to be trapped horizontally near the heating area but relatively extended in the vertical. As a consequence, diabatic heating cannot balance adiabatic cooling due to upward motion. At the levels slightly above the top of the heating, a negative vertical gradient of temperature perturbation appears. For the atmosphere driven by deep heating, however, the temperature perturbation cannot accumulate because the heating signals propagate away very fast, allowing an approximate equilibrium between the convective diabatic heating and adiabatic cooling due to upward motion. The converged moisture associated with circulation driven by shallow heating exceeds the amount needed to maintain the heat source. However, the circulation driven by deep heating does not feed back effectively to the moisture convergence, and thus cannot be self-sustaining. Based on these results, a new mechanism is proposed for the interaction between the large-scale convection and large-scale circulation. The new mechanism states that shallow heating drives a strong low-level moisture convergence so that the system of shallow heating and the forced large-scale circulation is unstable. When the unstable system reaches a certain amplitude, the stable cap layer immediately above the shallow heating erodes, and deep convection arises, which consumes most of the converged moisture at low levels without much feedback to the low-level convergence of moisture. The whole heating circulation system develops and dies; the estimated lifetime of such a system, based on the timescale of adjustment of tropical atmosphere to forcing, is on an intraseasonal timescale. Related observational and modeling evidence that support the new mechanism is discussed.},

It is shown that nondrizzle precipitation over tropical and subtropical oceans consists of two dominant modes of rainfall systems: deep systems and congestus. A rough estimate of the shallow-heating contribution against the total heating is about 46.7{\%} for the average tropical oceans, which is substantially larger than the 23.7{\%} over tropical land. Although cumulus congestus heating linearly correlates with SST, deep-mode heating is dynamically bounded by large-scale subsidence. It is notable that a substantial amount of rain, as large as 2.38 mm day?1 on average, is brought from congestus clouds under the large-scale subsiding circulation. It is also notable that, even in the region with SSTs warmer than 28$\,^{\circ}$C, large-scale subsidence effectively suppresses the deep convection, with the remaining heating by congestus clouds. The results support that the entrainment of mid?lower-tropospheric dry air, which accompanies the large-scale subsidence, is the major factor suppressing the deep convection. Therefore, a representation of the realistic entrainment is very important for proper reproduction of precipitation distribution and the resultant large-scale circulation.},

	Abstract = {AbstractA climatology of the structure of the low-altitude cloud field (tops below 4 km) over the Southern Ocean (40$\,^{\circ}$?65$\,^{\circ}$S) in the vicinity of Australia (100$\,^{\circ}$?160$\,^{\circ}$E) has been constructed with CloudSat products for liquid water and ice water clouds. Averaging over longitude and time, CloudSat produces a roughly uniform cloud field between heights of approximately 750 and 2250 m across the extent of the domain for both winter and summer. This cloud field makes a transition from consisting primarily of liquid water at the lower latitudes to ice water at the higher latitudes. This transition is primarily driven by the gradient in the temperature, which is commonly between 0$\,^{\circ}$and ?20$\,^{\circ}$C, rather than by direct physical observation.The uniform lower boundary is a consequence of the CloudSat cloud detection algorithm being unable to reliably separate radar returns because of the bright surface versus returns due to clouds, in the lowest four range bins above the surface. This is potentially very problematic over the Southern Ocean where the depth of the boundary layer has been observed to be as shallow as 500 m. Cloud fields inferred from upper-air soundings at Macquarie Island (54.62$\,^{\circ}$S, 158.85$\,^{\circ}$E) similarly suggest that the peak frequency lies between 260 and 500 m for both summer and winter.

Averaging over longitude and time, CloudSat produces a roughly uniform cloud field between heights of approximately 750 and 2250 m across the extent of the domain for both winter and summer. This cloud field makes a transition from consisting primarily of liquid water at the lower latitudes to ice water at the higher latitudes. This transition is primarily driven by the gradient in the temperature, which is commonly between 0$\,^{\circ}$and ?20$\,^{\circ}$C, rather than by direct physical observation.The uniform lower boundary is a consequence of the CloudSat cloud detection algorithm being unable to reliably separate radar returns because of the bright surface versus returns due to clouds, in the lowest four range bins above the surface. This is potentially very problematic over the Southern Ocean where the depth of the boundary layer has been observed to be as shallow as 500 m. Cloud fields inferred from upper-air soundings at Macquarie Island (54.62$\,^{\circ}$S, 158.85$\,^{\circ}$E) similarly suggest that the peak frequency lies between 260 and 500 m for both summer and winter. No immediate explanation is available for the uniformity of the cloud-top boundary. This lack of a strong seasonal cycle is, perhaps, remarkable given the large seasonal cycles in both the shortwave (SW) radiative forcing experienced and the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration over the Southern Ocean.},

In particular, model means failed to capture the strong July CLLJ peak as a result of the lack of westward and southward expansion of the North Atlantic subtropical high (NASH) between May and July. The NASH was also found to be too strong, particularly during the first 6 months of the year in the coupled model runs, which led to increased meridional sea level pressure gradients across the southern Caribbean and, hence, an overly strong CLLJ. The ability of the models to simulate the correlation between the CLLJ and regional precipitation varied based on season and region. During summer months, the negative correlation between the CLLJ and Caribbean precipitation anomalies was reproduced in the majority of models, with uncoupled models outperforming coupled models. The positive correlation between the CLLJ and the central U.S. precipitation during February was more challenging for the models, with the uncoupled models failing to reproduce a significant relationship.

	Abstract = {Abstract This paper presents observational evidence in support of the existence of a large diurnal cycle (one daily maximum and one daily minimum) of oceanic, tropical, deep cumulus convection. The more intense the deep convection and the more associated it is with organized weather systems, the more evident is a diurnal cycle with a maximum in the morning. At many places heavy rainfall is 2?3 times greater in the morning than in the late afternoon-evening. Many land stations also show morning maxima of heavy rainfall. The GATE observations show a similar diurnal range in heavy rainfall, but the time of maximum occurrence is in the afternoon. This occurrence is 6?7 h later than in most other oceanic regions and is probably a result of downwind influences from Africa and the fact that the GATE heavy rainfall was often associated with squall lines. Diurnal variations in low-level, layered and total cloudiness show a much smaller range. The variability of deep convection and heavy rainfall is not readily observable from those satellite pictures which cannot well resolve individual convective cells nor is it easily obtained from surface observations of the percent of sky coverage which are heavily weighted to the presence of low-level and layered clouds. A comparison of previous observational studies is made. It is hypothesized that the diurnal cycle in deep convection with a morning maximum is associated with organized weather disturbances.

	Abstract = {Abstract The states of thermal equilibrium (incorporating an adjustment of super-adiabatic stratification) as well as that of pure radiative equilibrium of the atmosphere are computed as the asymptotic steady state approached in an initial value problem. Recent measurements of absorptivities obtained for a wide range of pressure are used, and the scheme of computation is sufficiently general to include the effect of several layers of clouds. The atmosphere in thermal equilibrium has an isothermal lower stratosphere and an inversion in the upper stratosphere which are features observed in middle latitudes. The role of various gaseous absorbers (i.e., water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone), as well as the role of the clouds, is investigated by computing thermal equilibrium with and without one or two of these elements. The existence of ozone has very little effect on the equilibrium temperature of the earth's surface but a very important effect on the temperature throughout the stratosphere; the absorption of solar radiation by ozone in the upper and middle stratosphere, in addition to maintaining the warm temperature in that region, appears also to be necessary for the maintenance of the isothermal layer or slight inversion just above the tropopause. The thermal equilibrium state in the absence of solar insulation is computed by setting the temperature of the earth's surface at the observed polar value. In this case, the stratospheric temperature decreases monotonically with increasing altitude, whereas the corresponding state of pure radiative equilibrium has an inversion just above the level of the tropopause. A series of thermal equilibriums is computed for the distributions of absorbers typical of different latitudes. According to these results, the latitudinal variation of the distributions of ozone and water vapor may be partly responsible for the latitudinal variation of the thickness of the isothermal part of the stratosphere. Finally, the state of local radiative equilibrium of the stratosphere overlying a troposphere with the observed distribution of temperature is computed for each season and latitude. In the upper stratosphere of the winter hemisphere, a large latitudinal temperature gradient appears at the latitude of the polar-night jet stream, while in the upper statosphere of the summer hemisphere, the equilibrium temperature varies little with latitude. These features are consistent with the observed atmosphere. However, the computations predict an extremely cold polar night temperature in the upper stratosphere and a latitudinal decrease (toward the cold pole) of equilibrium temperature in the middle or lower stratosphere for winter and fall. This disagrees with observation, and suggests that explicit introduction of the dynamics of large scale motion is necessary.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Radiative convective equilibrium of the atmosphere with a given distribution of relative humidity is computed as the asymptotic state of an initial value problem. The results show that it takes almost twice as long to reach the state of radiative convective equilibrium for the atmosphere with a given distribution of relative humidity than for the atmosphere with a given distribution of absolute humidity. Also, the surface equilibrium temperature of the former is almost twice as sensitive to change of various factors such as solar constant, CO2 content, O3 content, and cloudiness, than that of the latter, due to the adjustment of water vapor content to the temperature variation of the atmosphere. According to our estimate, a doubling of the CO2 content in the atmosphere has the effect of raising the temperature of the atmosphere (whose relative humidity is fixed) by about 2C. Our model does not have the extreme sensitivity of atmospheric temperature to changes of CO2 content which was adduced by M{\"o}ller.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThis study investigates Atlantic warm pool (AWP) variability in the historical run of 19 coupled general circulation models (CGCMs) submitted to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). As with the CGCMs in phase 3 (CMIP3), most models suffer from the cold SST bias in the AWP region and also show very weak AWP variability as represented by the AWP area index. However, for the seasonal cycle the AWP SST bias of model ensemble and model sensitivities are decreased compared with CMIP3, indicating that the CGCMs are improved. The origin of the cold SST bias in the AWP region remains unknown, but among the CGCMs in CMIP5 excess (insufficient) high-level cloud simulation decreases (enhances) the cold SST bias in the AWP region through the warming effect of the high-level cloud radiative forcing. Thus, the AWP SST bias in CMIP5 is more modulated by an erroneous radiation balance due to misrepresentation of high-level clouds rather than low-level clouds as in CMIP3. AWP variability is assessed as in the authors' previous study in the aspects of spectral analysis, interannual variability, multidecadal variability, and comparison of the remote connections with ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) against observations. In observations the maximum influences of the NAO and ENSO on the AWP take place in boreal spring. For some CGCMs these influences erroneously last to late summer. The effect of this overestimated remote forcing can be seen in the variability statistics as shown in the rotated EOF patterns from the models. It is concluded that the NCAR Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Model E, version 2, coupled with the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) ocean model (GISS-E2H), and the GISS Model E, version 2, coupled with the Russell ocean model (GISS-E2R) are the best three models of CMIP5 in simulating AWP variability.},

	Abstract = {AbstractConventional wisdom suggests that subsidence favors the presence of marine stratus and stratocumulus because regions of enhanced boundary layer cloudiness are observed to climatologically co-occur with regions of enhanced subsidence. Here it is argued that the climatological positive correlation between subsidence and cloudiness is not the result of a direct physical mechanism connecting the two. Instead, it arises because enhanced subsidence is typically associated with stronger temperature inversions capping the marine boundary layer, and stronger temperature inversions favor greater cloudiness. Through statistical analysis of satellite cloud data and meteorological reanalyses for the subsidence regime over tropical (30$\,^{\circ}$S?30$\,^{\circ}$N) oceans, it is shown that enhanced subsidence promotes reduced cloudiness for the same value of inversion strength and that a stronger inversion favors greater cloudiness for the same value of subsidence. Using a simple conceptual model, it is argued that enhanced subsidence leads to reduced cloud thickness, liquid water path, and cloud fraction by pushing down the top of the marine boundary layer. Moreover, a stronger inversion reduces entrainment drying and warming, thus leading to a more humid boundary layer and greater cloud thickness, liquid water path, and cloud fraction. These two mechanisms typically oppose each other for geographical and seasonal cloud variability because enhanced subsidence is usually associated with stronger inversions. If global warming results in stronger inversions but weaker subsidence, the two mechanisms could both favor increased subtropical low-level cloudiness.},

@article{Soden:2002,
	Abstract = {The sensitivity of Earth's climate to an external radiative forcing depends critically on the response of water vapor. We use the global cooling and drying of the atmosphere that was observed after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo to test model predictions of the climate feedback from water vapor. Here, we first highlight the success of the model in reproducing the observed drying after the volcanic eruption. Then, by comparing model simulations with and without water vapor feedback, we demonstrate the importance of the atmospheric drying in amplifying the temperature change and show that, without the strong positive feedback from water vapor, the model is unable to reproduce the observed cooling. These results provide quantitative evidence of the reliability of water vapor feedback in current climate models, which is crucial to their use for global warming projections.},

@article{Sherwood:2014,
	Abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the ultimate change in global mean temperature in response to a change in external forcing. Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

	Abstract = {During the time, 3.2 × 109 years, that life has been present on Earth, the physical and chemical conditions of most of the planetary surface have never varied from those most favourable for life. The geological record reads that liquid water was always present and that the pH was never far from neutral. During this same period, however, the Earth's radiation environment underwent large changes. As the sun moved along the course set by the main sequence of stars its output will have increased at least 30% and possibly 100%. It may also have fluctuated in brightness over periods of a few million years. At the same time hydrogen was escaping to space from the Earth and so causing progressive changes in the chemical environment. This in turn through atmospheric compositional changes could have affected the Earth's radiation balance. It may have been that these physical and chemical changes always by blind chance followed the path whose bounds are the conditions favouring the continued existence of life. This paper offers an alternative explanation that, early after life began it acquired control of the planetary environment and that this homeostasis by and for the biosphere has persisted ever since. Historic and contemporary evidence and arguments for this hypothesis will be presented.DOI: 10.1111/j.2153-3490.1974.tb01946.x},

	Abstract = {The equivalent resolutions for two different global dynamic cores are established when they are coupled to the sub-grid scale parametrization suite of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3). One core adopts the common Eulerian spectral transform formalism, the other adopts a finite volume approach. The equivalent resolutions are established over a range of resolutions employed today for climate models. The comparison is done in the context of the Aqua Planet Experiment (APE). Thus, it is based on the characteristics of free, unforced motions, due in large part to the dynamic component driven by the parametrized processes and explicit dissipation. The forced component arising from surface orography and land--ocean--sea--ice contrasts is not considered. The resolution equivalences are demonstrated for a number of model fields. These include selected time averaged, global and zonal averaged fields, the meridional structure of eddy kinetic energy and eddy temperature variance, the mean meridional eddy transports, the characteristics of tropical wave propagation and probability density functions of precipitation. These fields indicate that the 2$\,^{\circ}$ finite volume model is equivalent to T42 spectral transform model, 1$\,^{\circ}$ is equivalent to T85 and 0.5$\,^{\circ}$ is equivalent to T170. This proportional relationship does not hold at lower resolutions.},

	Abstract = {Environmental context. Understanding the role of clouds in the warming and the cooling of the planet and how that role alters in a warming world is one of the biggest uncertainties climate change researchers face. Important in this regard is the influence on cloud properties of cloud condensation nuclei, the tiny atmospheric particles necessary for the nucleation of every single cloud droplet. The anthropogenic contribution to cloud condensation nuclei is known to be large in some regions through knowledge of pollutant emissions; however, the natural processes that regulate cloud condensation nuclei over large parts of the globe are less well understood. The CLAW hypothesis provides a mechanism by which plankton may modify climate through the atmospheric sulfur cycle via the provision of sulfate cloud condensation nuclei. The CLAW hypothesis was published over 20 years ago and has stimulated a great deal of research. Abstract. The CLAW hypothesis has for 20 years provided the intriguing prospect of oceanic and atmospheric systems exhibiting in an intimately coupled way a capacity to react to changing climate in a manner that opposes the change. A great number of quality scientific papers has resulted, many confirming details of specific links between oceanic phytoplankton and dimethylsulfide (DMS) emission to the atmosphere, the importance of DMS oxidation products in regulation of marine atmospheric cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) populations, and a concomitant influence on marine stratocumulus cloud properties. However, despite various links in the proposed phytoplankton--DMS--CCN--cloud albedo climate feedback loop being affirmed, there has been no overall scientific synthesis capable of adequately testing the hypothesis at a global scale. Moreover, significant gaps and contradictions remain, such as a lack of quantitative understanding of new particle formation processes in the marine atmospheric boundary layer, and of the extent to which dynamical, rather than microphysical, cloud feedbacks exist. Nevertheless, considerable progress has been made in understanding `Earth System Science'involving the integration of ocean and atmospheric systems inherent in the CLAW hypothesis. We present here a short review of this progress since the publication of the CLAW hypothesis.},

@techreport{Williamson:2012b,
	Annote = {This Atlas presents statistical analyses of the simulations submitted to the Aqua-Planet Experiment (APE) data archive. The simulations are from global Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCM) applied to a water-covered earth. The AGCMs include ones actively used or being developed for numerical weather prediction or climate research. Some are mature, application models and others are more novel and thus less well tested in Earth-like applications. The experiment applies AGCMs with their complete parameterization package to an idealization of the planet Earth which has a greatly simplified lower boundary that consists of an ocean only. It has no land and its associated orography, and no sea ice. The ocean is represented by Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) which are specified everywhere with simple, idealized distributions. Thus in the hierarchy of tests available for AGCMs, APE falls between tests with simplified forcings such as those proposed by Held and Suarez (1994) and Boer and Denis (1997) and Earth-like simulations of the Atmospheric Modeling Intercomparison Project (AMIP, Gates et al., 1999). Blackburn and Hoskins (2013) summarize the APE and its aims. They discuss where the APE fits within a modeling hierarchy which has evolved to evaluate complete models and which provides a link between realistic simulation and conceptual models of atmospheric phenomena. The APE bridges a gap in the existing hierarchy. The goals of APE are to provide a benchmark of current model behaviors and to stimulate research to understand the cause of inter-model differences. APE is sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) joint Commission on Atmospheric Science (CAS), World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Working Group on Numerical Experimentation (WGNE). Chapter 2 of this Atlas provides an overview of the specification of the eight APE experiments and of the data collected. Chapter 3 lists the participating models and includes brief descriptions of each. Chapters 4 through 7 present a wide variety of statistics from the 14 participating models for the eight different experiments. Additional intercomparison figures created by Dr. Yukiko Yamada in AGU group are available at http://www.gfd-dennou.org/library/ape/comparison/. This Atlas is intended to present and compare the statistics of the APE simulations but does not contain a discussion of interpretive analyses. Such analyses are left for journal papers such as those included in the Special Issue of the Journal of the Meteorological Society of Japan (2013, Vol. 91A) devoted to the APE. Two papers in that collection provide an overview of the simulations. One (Blackburn et al., 2013) concentrates on the CONTROL simulation and the other (Williamson et al., 2013) on the response to changes in the meridional SST profile. Additional papers provide more detailed analysis of the basic simulations, while others describe various sensitivities and applications. The APE experiment data base holds a wealth of data that is now publicly available from the APE web site: http://climate.ncas.ac.uk/ape/. We hope that this Atlas will stimulate future analyses and investigations to understand the large variation seen in the model behaviors.},

@article{Williams:2009a,
	Abstract = {We demonstrate a theoretically expected behavior of the tropical sea surface temperature probability density function (PDF) in future and past (Eocene) greenhouse climate simulations. To first order this consists of a shift to warmer temperatures as climate warms, without change of shape of the PDF. The behavior is tied to a shift of the temperature for deep convection onset. Consequently, the threshold for appearance of high clouds and associated radiative forcing shifts along with temperature. An excess entropy coordinate provides a reference to which the onset of deep convection is invariant, and gives a compact description of SST changes and cloud feedbacks suitable for diagnostics and as a basis for simplified climate models. The results underscore that the typically skewed appearance of tropical SST histograms, with a sharp drop-off above some threshold value, should not be taken as evidence for tropical thermostats.},

@article{Brient:2012,
	Abstract = {The influence of cloud modelling uncertainties on the projection of the tropical low-cloud response to global warming is explored by perturbing model parameters of the IPSL-CM5A climate model in a range of configurations (realistic general circulation model, aqua-planet, single-column model). While the positive sign and the mechanism of the low-cloud response to climate warming predicted by the model are robust, the amplitude of the response can vary considerably depending on the model tuning parameters. Moreover, the strength of the low-cloud response to climate change exhibits a strong correlation with the strength of the low-cloud radiative effects simulated in the current climate. We show that this correlation primarily results from a local positive feedback (referred to as the \&{\#}8220;beta feedback\&{\#}8221;) between boundary-layer cloud radiative cooling, relative humidity and low-cloud cover. Based on this correlation and observational constraints, it is suggested that the strength of the tropical low-cloud feedback predicted by the IPSL-CM5A model in climate projections might be overestimated by about fifty percent.},

	Abstract = {Although boundary layer processes are important in climate, weather and air quality, boundary layer climatology has received little attention, partly for lack of observational data sets. We analyze boundary layer climatology over Europe and the continental U.S. using a measure of boundary layer height based on the bulk Richardson number. Seasonal and diurnal variations during 1981\&{\#}8211;2005 are estimated from radiosonde observations, a reanalysis that assimilates observations, and two contemporary climate models that do not. Data limitations in vertical profiles introduce height uncertainties that can exceed 50{\%} for shallow boundary layers ({$<$}1 km) but are generally {$<$}20{\%} for deeper boundary layers. Climatological heights are typically {$<$}1 km during daytime and {$<$}0.5 km at night over both regions. Seasonal patterns for daytime and nighttime differ; daytime heights are larger in summer than winter, but nighttime heights are larger in winter. The four data sets show similar patterns of spatial and seasonal variability but with biases that vary spatially, seasonally, and diurnally. Compared with radiosonde observations, the reanalysis and the climate models produce deeper layers due to difficulty simulating stable conditions. The higher-time-resolution reanalysis reveals the diurnal cycle in height, with maxima in the afternoon, and with amplitudes that vary seasonally (larger in summer) and regionally (larger over western U.S. and southern Europe). The lower-time-resolution radiosonde data and climate model simulations capture diurnal variations better over Europe than over the U.S., due to differences in local sampling times.},

@article{Wyant:2012,
	Abstract = {Two-year simulation experiments with a superparameterized climate model, SP-CAM, are performed to understand the fast tropical (30S-30N) cloud response to an instantaneous quadrupling of CO2 concentration with SST held fixed at present-day values. The greenhouse effect of the CO2 perturbation quickly warms the tropical land surfaces by an average of 0.5†K. This shifts rising motion, surface precipitation, and cloud cover at all levels from the ocean to the land, with only small net tropical-mean cloud changes. There is a widespread average reduction of about 80†m in the depth of the trade inversion capping the marine boundary layer (MBL) over the cooler subtropical oceans. One apparent contributing factor is CO2-enhanced downwelling longwave radiation, which reduces boundary-layer radiative cooling, a primary driver of turbulent entrainment through the trade inversion. A second contributor is a slight CO2-induced heating of the free troposphere above the MBL, which strengthens the trade inversion and also inhibits entrainment. There is a corresponding downward displacement of MBL clouds with a very slight decrease in mean cloud cover and albedo. Two-dimensional cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulations of this MBL response are run to steady state using composite SP-CAM simulated thermodynamic and wind profiles from a representative cool subtropical ocean regime, for the control and 4xCO2 cases. Simulations with a CRM grid resolution equal to that of SP-CAM are compared with much finer resolution simulations. The coarse-resolution simulations maintain a cloud fraction and albedo comparable to SP-CAM, but the fine-resolution simulations have a much smaller cloud fraction. Nevertheless, both CRM configurations simulate a reduction in inversion height comparable to SP-CAM. The changes in low cloud cover and albedo in the CRM simulations are small, but both simulations predict a slight reduction in low cloud albedo as in SP-CAM.},

@article{Cao:2011,
	Abstract = {Recently, it was found that a reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentration leads to a temporary increase in global precipitation. We use the Hadley Center coupled atmosphere-ocean model, HadCM3L, to demonstrate that this precipitation increase is a consequence of precipitation sensitivity to changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations through fast tropospheric adjustment processes. Slow ocean cooling explains the longer-term decrease in precipitation. Increased CO2 tends to suppress evaporation/precipitation whereas increased temperatures tend to increase evaporation/precipitation. When the enhanced CO2 forcing is removed, global precipitation increases temporarily, but this increase is not observed when a similar negative radiative forcing is applied as a reduction of solar intensity. Therefore, transient precipitation increase following a reduction in CO2-radiative forcing is a consequence of the specific character of CO2 forcing and is not a general feature associated with decreases in radiative forcing.},

Associated with this widening is a poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone. Simple scaling analysis supports the notion that the poleward extent of the Hadley cell is set by the location where the thermally driven jet first becomes baroclinically unstable. The expansion of the Hadley cell is caused by an increase in the subtropical static stability, which pushes poleward the baroclinic instability zone and hence the outer boundary of the Hadley cell.},

This is the first application of the linear forcing-feedback regression analysis of Gregory et al. (2004) to an ensemble of AOGCMs. The range of equilibrium climate sensitivity is 2.1\&{\#}8211;4.7†K. Differences in cloud feedbacks continue to be important contributors to this range. Some models show small deviations from a linear dependence of top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes on global surface temperature change. We show that this phenomenon largely arises from shortwave cloud radiative effects over the ocean and is consistent with independent estimates of forcing using fixed sea-surface temperature methods. We suggest that future research should focus more on understanding transient climate change, including any time-scale dependence of the forcing and/or feedback, rather than on the equilibrium response to large instantaneous forcing.},

@article{Hendon:1993,
	Abstract = {The diurnal cycle of tropical convection is investigated with global cloud imagery constructed from 11\&{\#}956;m radiance measurements taken aboard six satellites. Four harmonics of the diurnal cycle are resolved in the cloud imagery with about 50 km horizontal resolution. To isolate deep convective activity from other processes which cause diurnal fluctuations in longwave radiance, an index of deep convective activity is constructed by thresholding to brightness temperatures less than 230 K. Significant diurnal amplitude of deep convection is found only over tropical landmasses. Over the tropical oceans the diurnal cycle is weak and is barely discernible from the background red spectrum of convective variance. Nonetheless, oceanic convection exhibits a systematic diurnal fluctuation with maximum intensity in the early morning. Nocturnal subsidence along the cloud-free equator is postulated to play a role in forcing diurnal variation in the intertropical convergence zones. Other mechanisms are also implied to contribute as a similar early morning maximum in deep convection is seen even where no adjoining cloud-free regions occur. The diurnal cycle of deep convection is found to be organized on planetary scales predominantly in nonmigrating modes (i.e., modes with phase speeds not equal to that of the Sun). The nonmigrating modes are postulated to be produced by the nonuniform distribution of convective centers. The nonmigrating, zonally symmetric component is found to be especially large. While the role of this mode in forcing diurnal variations of the tropospheric circulation (e.g., the Hadley cell) is questionable, its role in modulating the ionospheric electric potential is well established. Discrepancies with the traditional notion that cloud-to-ground lightning is the dominant mechanism by which the Earth is negatively charged are discussed. In particular, the probable role of nonlightning-producing clouds (e.g., the stratiform portion of convective complexes) in diurnally modulating the negative charge on Earth is discussed.},

@article{Haurwitz:1973,
	Abstract = {The global distributions of the annual and seasonal means of the diurnal ( S 1 ) and semidiurnal ( S 2 ) surface pressure oscillations are investigated by spherical harmonic analysis. The main waves are, S 1 1 (with wave number 1) for S 1 and S 2 2 for S 2 . S 1 1 is much less predominant among the waves of S 1 than S 2 2 among those of S 2 . As in the case of the lunar semidiurnal barometric tide L 2 the pressure maxima occur earlier in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere. In the case of S 2 the standing wave S 2 0 and the wave S 2 3 are also of interest besides S 2 2 . Although the present analysis extends only from 60$\,^{\circ}$N to 60$\,^{\circ}$S, while S 2 0 is largest at polar latitudes, its results show that S 2 0 should be smaller at high southerly than at high northerly latitudes, as has been observed. Thus this observed asymmetrical distribution of S 2 0 may be due to causes outside the polar regions rather than to their geographical differences. The best approximation to the observed distribution of S 2 0 is obtained by including a mode representing an oscillation independent of longitude and latitude indicating a small semidiurnal variation of the mean global surface presure, which is an unlikely result on physical grounds.},

@article{Takahashi:2012,
	Abstract = {The diurnal cycle in the oceanic surface winds in the tropical eastern Pacific is shown, through numerical experiments with a regional atmospheric model, to be associated with the migrating diurnal atmospheric thermal tide, forced by absorption of solar near-IR radiation by tropospheric water vapor, and a topographically-modified extended sea-breeze, forced by diurnal land heating. Idealized experiments prove capable of discriminating the effects of both processes, showing that beyond 2000km from the coast, the thermal tide is dominant, while closer to the coast both processes are of the same order. The shortwave forcing due to water vapor is also found to produce a diurnal cycle in precipitation, but the process appears to be independent from the thermal tide and it is proposed that this effect is mediated by the radiatively-forced changes in the column stability.},

	Abstract = {There are notable differences in the joint histograms of cloud top height and optical depth being produced from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multiangle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) and by the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). These differences have their roots in the different retrieval approaches used by the three projects and are driven largely by responses of the retrievals to (1) stratocumulus (or more broadly low-level clouds under temperature inversions), (2) small (subpixel) or broken low-level clouds, and (3) multilayer clouds. Because each data set has different strengths and weakness, the combination tells us more about the observed cloud fields than any of the three by itself. In particular, the MISR stereo height retrieval provides a calibration insensitive approach to determining cloud height that is especially valuable in combination with ISCCP or MODIS because the combination provides a means to estimate the amount of multilayer cloud, where the upper cloud is optically thin. In this article we present a review of the three data sets using case studies and comparisons of annually averaged joint histograms on global and regional scales. Recommendations for using these data in climate model evaluations are provided.},

@article{Alterskjaer:2010,
	Abstract = {Earlier studies suggest that aerosol-cloud interactions may have contributed to the increase in surface air temperature recently observed in the Arctic. While those studies focused on longwave effects of strong pollution events around Barrow, Alaska, we use a global climate model (CAM-Oslo) to study the annual and seasonal net radiative effect of aerosol-cloud interactions over the entire Arctic region. The model is validated against and adjusted to match observations from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean campaign along with measuring stations within the Arctic region. Several sensitivity experiments were conducted which included changes in both cloud properties and aerosol concentrations. Results show that the longwave indirect effect at the surface lies between 0.10 and 0.85 W/m2 averaged annually north of 71∞N, while the shortwave indirect effect lies between \&{\#}8722;1.29 W/m2 and \&{\#}8722;0.52 W/m2. Due to longwave dominance in winter, 6 of 11 simulations give a positive change in net cloud forcing between October and May (\&{\#}8722;0.16 to 0.29 W/m2), while the change in forcing averaged over the summer months is negative for all model simulations (from \&{\#}8722;2.63 to \&{\#}8722;0.23 W/m2). The annually averaged change in net cloud forcing at the surface is negative in 10 of 11 simulations, lying between \&{\#}8722;0.98 and 0.12 W/m2. In conclusion, our results point to a small decrease in the surface radiative flux due to the aerosol indirect effect in the Arctic, but these estimates are subject to uncertainties in the frequency of thin clouds and biases in the estimated cloud cover.},

@article{Liu:2002a,
	Abstract = {The high-resolution wind vectors observed by the space-based scatterometer QuikSCAT, from 1999 to 2002, show that the double intertropical convergence zones (ITCZ) exist in the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific oceans for most of the annual cycle, and are far more extensive than previously recognized. For most of the time, the southern ITCZ is weaker than the northern one. The stronger ITCZ occurs when the northerly trade winds meet the southerly trade winds over warm water, resulting in deep convection. The weaker ITCZ over cooler water is caused by the deceleration of the surface winds as they approach the cold upwelling water near the equator. Decreases in vertical mixing and increases in vertical wind shear in the atmospheric boundary layer are suggested to be the causes of the deceleration of the trade winds as they move from warmer to colder water.},

@article{Zhang:2001,
	Abstract = {This study examines where and when double InterTropical Convergence Zones (ITCZs) exist and whether double ITCZs, defined in terms of monthly precipitation distributions, are significant climatological features in the tropics. The most identifiable double ITCZ is found over the eastern Pacific during boreal spring, mainly in March and April. Weak signals of a double ITCZ exist over the Indian Ocean during November, but only infrequently. Over the western and central Pacific, signatures of a double ITCZ can often be found, but mostly during June through September. No double ITCZ is found over the Atlantic Ocean. The boreal - spring double ITCZ over the eastern Pacific fails to exist only during El Ni{\`O}o - Southern Oscillation warm phases, when it is replaced by a single ITCZ at the equator as the cold tongue disappears and the maximum sea surface temperature emerges at the equator. It is therefore concluded that double ITCZs are significant features of the tropical climate even though they undergo spatial and temporal variations. Simple composites of double ITCZs and associated surface conditions indicate that double ITCZs, at least over the Pacific Ocean, exist when there are local minima in surface humidity and temperature along the equator. On the basis of the limited observations, it is proposed that double ITCZs in the Pacific are more causally related to surface thermal conditions than atmospheric internal dynamics alone. During boreal spring a special distribution in sea surface temperature with its local minimum at the equator (i.e., the cold tongue) and two maxima at each side is necessary for the double ITCZ over the eastern Pacific. The westward advection of cold and dry surface air by the easterlies from the cold - tongue region is instrumental in the double ITCZ over the central and western Pacific.},

	Abstract = {Global warming is expected to lead to a large increase in atmospheric water vapor content and to changes in the hydrological cycle, which include an intensification of precipitation extremes. The intensity of precipitation extremes is widely held to increase proportionately to the increase in atmospheric water vapor content. Here, we show that this is not the case in 21st-century climate change scenarios simulated with climate models. In the tropics, precipitation extremes are not simulated reliably and do not change consistently among climate models; in the extratropics, they consistently increase more slowly than atmospheric water vapor content. We give a physical basis for how precipitation extremes change with climate and show that their changes depend on changes in the moist-adiabatic temperature lapse rate, in the upward velocity, and in the temperature when precipitation extremes occur. For the tropics, the theory suggests that improving the simulation of upward velocities in climate models is essential for improving predictions of precipitation extremes; for the extratropics, agreement with theory and the consistency among climate models increase confidence in the robustness of predictions of precipitation extremes under climate change.},

@article{Sugiyama:2010,
	Abstract = {Precipitation extreme changes are often assumed to scale with, or are constrained by, the change in atmospheric moisture content. Studies have generally confirmed the scaling based on moisture content for the midlatitudes but identified deviations for the tropics. In fact half of the twelve selected Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) models exhibit increases faster than the climatological-mean precipitable water change for high percentiles of tropical daily precipitation, albeit with significant intermodel scatter. Decomposition of the precipitation extreme changes reveals that the variations among models can be attributed primarily to the differences in the upward velocity. Both the amplitude and vertical profile of vertical motion are found to affect precipitation extremes. A recently proposed scaling that incorporates these dynamical effects can capture the basic features of precipitation changes in both the tropics and midlatitudes. In particular, the increases in tropical precipitation extremes significantly exceed the precipitable water change in Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC), a coupled general circulation model with the highest resolution among IPCC climate models whose precipitation characteristics have been shown to reasonably match those of observations. The expected intensification of tropical disturbances points to the possibility of precipitation extreme increases beyond the moisture content increase as is found in MIROC and some of IPCC models.},

	Abstract = {Twelve large-eddy simulations, with a wide range of microphysical representations, are compared to each other and to independent measurements. The measurements and the initial and forcing data for the simulations are taken from the undisturbed period of the Rain in Cumulus over the Ocean (RICO) field study. A regional downscaling of meteorological analyses is performed so as to provide forcing data consistent with the measurements. The ensemble average of the simulations plausibly reproduces many features of the observed clouds, including the vertical structure of cloud fraction, profiles of cloud and rain water, and to a lesser degree the population density of rain drops. The simulations do show considerable departures from one another in the representation of the cloud microphysical structure and the ensuant surface precipitation rates, increasingly so for the more simplified microphysical models. There is a robust tendency for simulations that develop rain to produce a shallower, somewhat more stable cloud layer. Relations between cloud cover and precipitation are ambiguous.},

	Abstract = {Observations of boundary-layer cloud have been made using radar and lidar at Chilbolton, Hampshire, UK. These have been compared with output from 7 different global and regional models. Fifty-five cloudy days have been composited to reveal the mean diurnal variation of cloud top and base heights, cloud thickness and liquid water path of the clouds. To enable like-for-like comparison between model and observations, the observations have been averaged on to the grid of each model. The composites show a distinct diurnal cycle in observed cloud; the cloud height exhibits a sinusoidal variation throughout the day with a maximum at around 1600 and a minimum at around 0700 UTC. This diurnal cycle is captured by six of the seven models analysed, although the models generally under-predict both cloud top and cloud base heights throughout the day. The two worst performing models in terms of cloud boundaries also have biases of around a factor of two in liquid water path; these were the only two models that did not include an explicit formulation for cloud-top entrainment.},

@article{Boyle:2005,
	Abstract = {The Community Atmospheric Model 2 (CAM2) is run as a short-term (1\&{\#}8211;5 days) forecast model initialized with reanalysis data. The intent is to reveal model deficiencies before complex interactions obscure the root error sources. Integrations are carried out for three Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program intensive operational periods (IOPs): June/July 1997, April 1997, and March 2000. The ARM data are used to validate the model in detail for the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site for all the periods and in the tropical west Pacific for the March 2000 period. The model errors establish themselves quickly, and within 3 days the model has evolved into a state distinctly different from the ARM observations. The summer forecasts evince a systematic error in convective rainfall. This error manifests itself in the temperature and moisture profiles after a single diurnal cycle. The same error characteristics are seen in the March 2000 tropical west Pacific forecasts. The model performs well in the spring cases at the SGP. Most of the error is manifested during rainy periods. The ARM cloud radar comparison to the model reveals cloud errors which are consistent with the relative humidity profile errors. The cloud errors are similar to those seen in climatological integrations, but the state variable errors are different. Thus there is the possibility that the some basic parameterization errors are obscured in the climatological integrations. The approach described here will facilitate parameterization experimentation, diagnoses, and validation. One way of reducing cloud feedback uncertainty is to make the physical processes behave in the most realistic manner possible. Paradoxically, perhaps the best way to reduce uncertainty in cloud feedback mechanisms is to evaluate the model processes with realistic forcing before such feedbacks have any significant affect.},

@article{Ramanathan:1989a,
	Abstract = {The study of climate and climate change is hindered by a lack of information on the effect of clouds on the radiation balance of the earth, referred to as the cloud-radiative forcing. Quantitative estimates of the global distributions of cloud-radiative forcing have been obtained from the spaceborne Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) launched in 1984. For the April 1985 period, the global shortwave cloud forcing [-44.5 watts per square meter (W/m2)] due to the enhancement of planetary albedo, exceeded in magnitude the longwave cloud forcing (31.3 W/m2) resulting from the greenhouse effect of clouds. Thus, clouds had a net cooling effect on the earth. This cooling effect is large over the mid-and high-latitude oceans, with values reaching -100 W/m2. The monthly averaged longwave cloud forcing reached maximum values of 50 to 100 W/m2 over the convectively disturbed regions of the tropics. However, this heating effect is nearly canceled by a correspondingly large negative shortwave cloud forcing, which indicates the delicately balanced state of the tropics. The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling. Hence, small changes in the cloud-radiative forcing fields can play a significant role as a climate feedback mechanism. For example, during past glaciations a migration toward the equator of the field of strong, negative cloud-radiative forcing, in response to a similar migration of cooler waters, could have significantly amplified oceanic cooling and continental glaciation.},

@article{Wood:2002,
	Abstract = {The diurnal cycle of liquid water path (LWP) over the subtropical and tropical oceans is examined using two complete years of TMI (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager) satellite microwave radiometer data. Diurnal amplitudes are a considerable fraction of the mean, especially in low cloud regions to the west of continents, where values of 15\&{\#}8211;35{\%} are typical. Early morning maxima occur throughout most of the subtropics, consistent with a diurnal cycle driven largely by cloud solar absorption. In deep convective regions of the west Pacific the diurnal cycle is also strong and peaks slightly later. Interestingly, the diurnal amplitude in the SE Pacific and Atlantic stratus regions is considerably larger than in their northern hemisphere counterparts, suggesting differences in the dynamics and structure of low clouds may exist from region to region. The data provide important constraints for models simulating the diurnal cycle of clouds.},

@article{Williams:2009,
	Abstract = {Differences in the radiative feedback from clouds account for much of the variation in climate sensitivity amongst General Circulation Models (GCMs). Therefore metrics of model performance which are demonstrated to be relevant to the cloud response to climate change form an important contribution to the overall evaluation of GCMs. In this paper we demonstrate an alternative method for assigning model data to observed cloud regimes obtained from clustering histograms of cloud amount in joint cloud optical depth---cloud top pressure classes. The method removes some of the subjectivity that exists in previous GCM cloud clustering studies. We apply the method to ten GCMs submitted to the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP), evaluate the simulated cloud regimes and analyse the climate change response in the context of these regimes. We also propose two cloud regime metrics, one of which is specifically targeted at assessing GCMs for the purpose of obtaining the global cloud radiative response to climate change. Most of the global variance in the cloud radiative response between GCMs is due to low clouds, with 47% arising from the stratocumulus regime and 18% due to the regime characterised by clouds undergoing transition from stratocumulus to cumulus. This result is found to be dominated by two structurally similar GCMs. The shallow cumulus regime, though widespread, has a smaller contribution and reduces the variance. For the stratocumulus and transition regimes, part of the variance results from a large model spread in the radiative properties of the regime in the control simulation. Comparison with observations reveals a systematic bias for both the stratocumulus and transition regimes to be overly reflective. If this bias was corrected with all other aspects of the response unchanged, the variance in the low cloud response would reduce. The response of some regimes with high cloud tops differ between the GCMs. These regimes are simulated too infrequently in a few of the models. If the frequency in the control simulation were more realistic and changes within the regimes were unaltered, the variance in the cloud radiative response from high-top clouds would increase. As a result, use of observations of the mean present-day cloud regimes suggests that whilst improvements in the simulation of the cloud regimes would impact the climate sensitivity, the inter-model variance may not reduce. When the cloud regime metric is calculated for the GCMs analysed here, only one model is on average consistent with observations within their uncertainty (and even this model is not consistent with the observations for all regimes), indicating scope for improvement in the simulation of cloud regimes.},

@article{Hartmann:1991,
	Abstract = {The net effect of clouds on the energy balance at the top of the atmosphere is investigated using data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment. A regional analysis is made of the relative magnitudes of the effects of clouds on outgoing longwave radiation and on reflected solar radiation. The ratio of these two effects is expressed in terms of a cloud factor angle defined in coordinates of reflected solar versus outgoing longwave radiation. This parameter is a measure of the net radiative effectiveness of clouds, which is insensitive to the average amount of cloud present. It is calculated in two independent ways. One method uses monthly averaged clear-sky and average values, and the other uses regression between daily values of solar and longwave exitance. Because the effect of cloud amount variations is minimized by the analysis procedure used here, the spatial pattern of cloud radiative effectiveness is simpler than that of cloud radiative forcing and corresponds to the pattern of circulation and cloud type regimes. The two methods of estimating the effectiveness give essentially the same spatial pattern. Both estimates of the cloud radiative effectiveness indicate that the global average net radiative effect of today's clouds is cooling, with the decrease in absorbed solar greater than the decrease in outgoing longwave radiation. The ratio of the solar to the longwave effect of cloud is about 1.85 based on the regression method and 1.55 based on the comparison of clear-sky and average radiation budget climatologies. The differences between the two methods arise primarily from regions of stratus cloud, tropical cumulonimbus cloud and clouds over snow. In each of these regions the regression method indicates a more strongly cooling effect. The difference between the global mean estimates is within their uncertainty. Investigation of the areas of disagreement between the two methods reveals remaining problems. Significant improvement in our understanding of the effect of clouds on the radiation balance will require that the analysis procedure incorporate simultaneous measurements of temperature, humidity, and cloud structure, with particular importance attached to humidity in the deep tropics and temperature over land surfaces. Additional spectral information will be necessary to discriminate the role of clouds over snow and ice.},

These in turn lead to large reductions in the amount of solar irradiance reaching Earth's surface, a corresponding increase in solar heating of the atmosphere, changes in the atmospheric temperature structure, suppression of rainfall, and less efficient removal of pollutants. These aerosol effects can lead to a weaker hydrological cycle, which connects directly to availability and quality of fresh water, a major environmental issue of the 21st century.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of low-level cloud in the tropical belt is investigated using 6 months of Level 2 retrievals from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) at 333 m and 1 km horizontal resolutions. Regional patterns of tropical clouds emerge from the data, matching expectations from existing observations. The advantage of the lidar is highlighted by the distribution of cloud-top height, revealing the preponderance of low-level clouds over the tropical oceans. Over land, cloud top is more uniformly distributed under the influence of diurnal variation. The integrated cloud-top distribution suggests tropical, marine low-cloud amount around 25\&{\#}8211;30{\%}; a merged CALIPSO-CloudSat product has a similar cloud-top distribution and includes a complementary estimate of cloud fraction based on the lidar detections. The low-cloud distribution is similar to that found in fields of shallow cumulus observed during the Rain in Cumulus Over the Ocean (RICO) field study. The similarity is enhanced by sampling near the RICO site or sampling large-scale conditions similar to those during RICO. This finding shows how satellite observations can help to generalize findings from detailed field observations.},

@article{Seidel:2010,
	Abstract = {Planetary boundary layer (PBL) processes control energy, water, and pollutant exchanges between the surface and free atmosphere. However, there is no observation-based global PBL climatology for evaluation of climate, weather, and air quality models or for characterizing PBL variability on large space and time scales. As groundwork for such a climatology, we compute PBL height by seven methods, using temperature, potential temperature, virtual potential temperature, relative humidity, specific humidity, and refractivity profiles from a 10 year, 505-station radiosonde data set. Six methods are directly compared; they generally yield PBL height estimates that differ by several hundred meters. Relative humidity and potential temperature gradient methods consistently give higher PBL heights, whereas the parcel (or mixing height) method yields significantly lower heights that show larger and more consistent diurnal and seasonal variations (with lower nighttime and wintertime PBLs). Seasonal and diurnal patterns are sometimes associated with local climatological phenomena, such as nighttime radiation inversions, the trade inversion, and tropical convection and associated cloudiness. Surface-based temperature inversions are a distinct type of PBL that is more common at night and in the morning than during midday and afternoon, in polar regions than in the tropics, and in winter than other seasons. PBL height estimates are sensitive to the vertical resolution of radiosonde data; standard sounding data yield higher PBL heights than high-resolution data. Several sources of both parametric and structural uncertainty in climatological PBL height values are estimated statistically; each can introduce uncertainties of a few 100 m.},

We find that the three leading SVD modes respectively account for 63{\%}, 20{\%} and 6{\%} of the total square covariance. The first mode represents an approximately 15\&{\#}8208;year period oscillation in the strength of the subtropical anticyclone, accompanied by fluctuations of a north\&{\#}8208;south dipole structure in the SST. It appears to be linked to the global\&{\#}8208;scale interdecadal (15\&{\#}8208;year) joint mode in SST and SLP recently studied by Mann and Park. The second mode is characterized by east\&{\#}8208;west displacements of the anticyclone center, in association with strong 6 to 7\&{\#}8208;year period fluctuations of SST off the coast of Africa. The third mode is characterized by north\&{\#}8208;south displacements of the anticyclone and 4\&{\#}8208;year period fluctuations in the SST in a broad band across the central South Atlantic. This mode is strongly correlated with ENSO.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a modified formulation of stratiform condensation rate associated with fractional cloudiness in the Community Atmospheric Model Version 2 (CAM2). It introduces an equation to link cloudiness change with the variation of total condensate. Together with a diagnostic cloud relationship that represents subgrid-scale variability of relative humidity, a closed system is formed to calculate the fractional condensation rate. As a result, the new formulation eliminates the two closure assumptions in the Rasch and Kristj‡nsson {$[$}1998{$]$} prognostic cloud scheme. It also extends the Sundqvist {$[$}1978{$]$} scheme by including the influence of convective detrainment and advection of condensates on the fractional cloudiness. Comparison is made between the present formulation and the Rasch and Kristj‡nsson scheme by using data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program and through global model simulations with CAM2. It is shown that relative to the Rasch and Kristj‡nsson scheme, the new formulation produces less clouds and a slightly warmer troposphere, thus reducing the original cold bias in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM). Even though the overall impact of the new formulation on the model climate is small, the modifications lead to more consistent treatments of fractional cloudiness change, condensation rate, and cloud water change in the model.},

@article{Wyant:2007,
	Abstract = {This study presents an intercomparison of single-column model simulations of a nocturnal heavily drizzling marine stratocumulus-topped boundary layer. Initial conditions and forcings are based on nocturnal flight observations off the coast of California during the DYCOMS-II field experiment. Differences in turbulent and microphysical parameterizations between models were isolated by slightly idealizing and standardizing the specification of surface and radiative fluxes. For most participating models, the case was run at both typical operational vertical resolution of about 100 m and also at high vertical resolution of about 10 m. As in prior stratocumulus intercomparisons, the simulations quickly develop considerable scatter in liquid water path (LWP) between models. However, the simulated dependence of cloud base drizzle fluxes on LWP in most models is broadly consistent with recent observations. Sensitivity tests with drizzle turned off show that drizzle substantially decreases LWP for many models. The sensitivity of entrainment rate to drizzle is more muted. Simulated LWP and entrainment are also sensitive to the inclusion of cloud droplet sedimentation. Many models underestimate the fraction of drizzle that evaporates below cloud base, which may distort the simulated feedbacks of drizzle on turbulence, entrainment, and LWP.},

@article{Bretherton:2010,
	Abstract = {In marine stratocumulus-capped boundary layers under strong inversions, the timescale for thermodynamic adjustment is roughly a day, much shorter than the multiday timescale for inversion height adjustment. Slow-manifold analysis is introduced to exploit this timescale separation when boundary layer air columns experience only slow changes in their boundary conditions. Its essence is that the thermodynamic structure of the boundary layer remains approximately slaved to its inversion height and the instantaneous boundary conditions; this slaved structure determines the entrainment rate and hence the slow evolution of the inversion height.</p><p>Slow-manifold analysis is shown to apply to mixed-layer model and large-eddy simulations of an idealized nocturnal stratocumulus- capped boundary layer; simulations with different initial inversion heights collapse onto single relationships of cloud properties with inversion height. Depending on the initial inversion height, the simulations evolve toward a shallow thin-cloud boundary layer or a deep, well-mixed thick cloud boundary layer. In the large-eddy simulations, these evolutions occur on two separate slow manifolds (one of which becomes unstable if cloud droplet concentration is reduced). Applications to analysis of stratocumulus observations and to pockets of open cells and ship tracks are proposed.},

	Abstract = {Variations in solar radiation incident at Earth's surface profoundly affect the human and terrestrial environment. A decline in solar radiation at land surfaces has become apparent in many observational records up to 1990, a phenomenon known as global dimming. Newly available surface observations from 1990 to the present, primarily from the Northern Hemisphere, show that the dimming did not persist into the 1990s. Instead, a widespread brightening has been observed since the late 1980s. This reversal is reconcilable with changes in cloudiness and atmospheric transmission and may substantially affect surface climate, the hydrological cycle, glaciers, and ecosystems. },

If the multi-model ensemble mean time series provides a true representation of forced change by greenhouse gas (GHG) loading, 33\&{\#}8211;38{\%} of the observed September trend from 1953\&{\#}8211;2006 is externally forced, growing to 47\&{\#}8211;57{\%} from 1979\&{\#}8211;2006. Given evidence that as a group, the models underestimate the GHG response, the externally forced component may be larger.

@article{Jones:2009,
	Abstract = {Theoretical potential geoengineering solutions to the global warming problem have recently been proposed. Here, we present an idealized study of the climate response to deliberately seeding large-scale stratocumulus cloud decks in the North Pacific, South Pacific, and South Atlantic, thereby inducing cooling via aerosol indirect effects. Atmosphere-only, atmosphere/mixed-layer ocean, and fully coupled atmosphere/ocean versions of the Met Office Hadley Centre model are used to investigate the radiative forcing, climate efficacy, and regional response of temperature, precipitation, and net primary productivity to such geoengineering. The radiative forcing simulations indicate that, for our parameterization of aerosol indirect effects, up to 35{\%} of the radiative forcing due to current levels of greenhouse gases could be offset by stratocumulus modification. Equilibrium simulations with the atmosphere/mixed-layer ocean model, wherein each of the three stratocumulus sheets is modified in turn, reveal that the most efficient cooling per unit radiative forcing occurs when the South Pacific stratocumulus sheet is modified. Transient coupled model simulations suggest that geoengineering all three stratocumulus areas delays the simulated global warming by about 25 years. These simulations also indicate that, while some areas experience increases in precipitation and net primary productivity, sharp decreases are simulated in South America, with particularly detrimental impacts on the Amazon rain forest. These results show that, while some areas benefit from geoengineering, there are significant areas where the response could be very detrimental with implications for the practical applicability of such a scheme.},

The observed damping rates are generally consistent with positive radiative feedbacks over the tropical oceans, in agreement with climate model simulations. The model-simulated radiative damping rates are shown to be much more robust when analyzed at global scales, rather than tropical-means. Moreover, the model-simulated values of global-mean radiative damping rates deduced from interannual variability are shown to be modestly correlated to the climate sensitivity of the model in response to increasing CO2.},

	Abstract = {Recent paleoclimate proxy reconstructions show that tropical surface temperatures may have been as high as 35∞\&{\#}8211;40∞C in the Early Cenozoic. Here, we study the tropical atmospheric circulation's response to temperatures in this range using a full-complexity atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). We find that when equatorial surface temperatures exceed \&{\#}8764;33∞C, the model undergoes a transition to equatorial superrotation, a state with strong annual- and zonal-mean westerlies on the equator. The transition is driven by zonal momentum convergence due to large-amplitude transient eddies on the equator. These eddies have a structure similar to the observed Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The model's MJO variability is weaker than observed when simulating the modern climate but increases sharply with temperature, coming to dominate the tropical variability and mean state of the warmest climates.},

@article{Murphy:2009,
	Abstract = {We examine the Earth's energy balance since 1950, identifying results that can be obtained without using global climate models. Important terms that can be constrained using only measurements and radiative transfer models are ocean heat content, radiative forcing by long-lived trace gases, and radiative forcing from volcanic eruptions. We explicitly consider the emission of energy by a warming Earth by using correlations between surface temperature and satellite radiant flux data and show that this term is already quite significant. About 20{\%} of the integrated positive forcing by greenhouse gases and solar radiation since 1950 has been radiated to space. Only about 10{\%} of the positive forcing (about 1/3 of the net forcing) has gone into heating the Earth, almost all into the oceans. About 20{\%} of the positive forcing has been balanced by volcanic aerosols, and the remaining 50{\%} is mainly attributable to tropospheric aerosols. After accounting for the measured terms, the residual forcing between 1970 and 2000 due to direct and indirect forcing by aerosols as well as semidirect forcing from greenhouse gases and any unknown mechanism can be estimated as \&{\#}8722;1.1 $\pm$0.4 W m\&{\#}8722;2 (1\&{\#}963;). This is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's best estimates but rules out very large negative forcings from aerosol indirect effects. Further, the data imply an increase from the 1950s to the 1980s followed by constant or slightly declining aerosol forcing into the 1990s, consistent with estimates of trends in global sulfate emissions. An apparent increase in residual forcing in the late 1990s is discussed.},

	Abstract = {The occurrence statistics of hydrometeor layers covering the Earth's surface is described using the first year of millimeter radar data collected by Cloudsat merged with lidar data collected by CALIPSO (July 2006 to June 2007). These satellites are flown in a tight orbital configuration so that they probe nearly the same volumes of the atmosphere within 10--15 s of each other. This configuration combined with the capacity for millimeter radar to penetrate optically thick hydrometeor layers and the ability of the lidar to detect optically thin clouds has allowed us to characterize the vertical and horizontal structure of hydrometeor layers with unprecedented precision. We find that the global hydrometeor coverage averages 76{\%} and demonstrates a fairly smooth annual cycle with a range of 3{\%} peaking in October 2006 and reaching a minimum in March 2007. The geographic distribution of hydrometeor layers defined in terms of layer base, layer top, and layer thickness is described. The predominance of geometrically thin boundary layer clouds is illustrated as is the spatial distribution of upper tropospheric ice clouds in the tropics. The cooccurrence of multiple layers is shown to be a strong function of latitude and geography with cooccurring middle‐level (3 km < layer base < 6 km) and high‐level (base > 6 km) layers being predominant over the continents. Cloud layer overlap is also examined, and a bias due to an assumption of maximum fractional overlap in coarse resolution models is quantified and shown to be on the order of −5 to −7{\%} globally maximizing over the high‐latitude continents of the Northern Hemisphere.},

	Abstract = {Forecasts of southeast Pacific stratocumulus at 20{${}^\circ$}S and 85{${}^\circ$}W during the East Pacific Investigation of Climate (EPIC) cruise of October 2001 are examined with the ECMWF model, the Atmospheric Model (AM) from GFDL, the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) from NCAR, and the CAM with a revised atmospheric boundary layer formulation from the University of Washington (CAM-UW). The forecasts are initialized from ECMWF analyses and each model is run for 3\&{\#}8211;5 days to determine the differences with the EPIC field observations.Observations during the EPIC cruise show a well-mixed boundary layer under a sharp inversion. The inversion height and the cloud layer have a strong and regular diurnal cycle. A key problem common to the models is that the planetary boundary layer (PBL) depth is too shallow when compared to EPIC observations. However, it is suggested that improved PBL depths are achieved with more physically realistic PBL schemes: at one end, CAM uses a dry and surface-driven PBL scheme and produces a very shallow PBL, while the ECWMF model uses an eddy-diffusivity/mass-flux approach and produces a deeper and better-mixed PBL. All the models produce a strong diurnal cycle in the liquid water path (LWP), but there are large differences in the amplitude and phase when compared to the EPIC observations. This, in turn, affects the radiative fluxes at the surface and the surface energy budget. This is particularly relevant for coupled simulations as this can lead to a large SST bias. },

@article{Lenschow:2007,
	Abstract = {This paper considers the accuracy of divergence estimates obtained from aircraft measurements of the horizontal velocity field and points out an error that appears in these estimates that has heretofore not been addressed. A procedure for eliminating this error is presented. The divergence and vorticity are estimated from the coefficients of a least squares fit to a wind field obtained from the Second Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS-II) circular flight legs. These estimates are compared with estimates from numerical models and satellites and with airplane estimates based on tracer budgets and the temporal changes in cloud-top height. The estimates are consistent with expectations and estimates using other methods, albeit somewhat high. Furthermore, significant differences occur among the cases, likely due to the large differences in the techniques. The results indicate that the wind field technique is a viable approach for estimating mesoscale divergence if the wind measurements are accurate. The largest source of wind field systematic error may be the result of flow distortion effects on the air velocity measurement and limitations of in-flight calibrations. Because of flow distortion, the only way the current systems can be calibrated is by flight maneuvers, which assume a steady-state homogeneous nonturbulent atmosphere. Analysis of the errors in this technique suggests that wind field measurements with minimal systematic errors should provide estimates of divergence with much greater accuracy than is now possible with other existing methods. },

@article{Trenberth:2000,
	Abstract = {A comprehensive description is given of the global monsoon as seen through the large-scale overturning in the atmosphere that changes with the seasons, and it provides a basis for delimiting the monsoon regions of the world. The analysis focuses on the mean annual cycle of the divergent winds and associated vertical motions, as given by the monthly mean fields for 1979\&{\#}8211;93 reanalyses from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\&{\#}8211;National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP\&{\#}8211;NCAR) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which are able to reproduce the dominant modes. A complex empirical orthogonal function analysis of the divergent circulation brings out two dominant modes with essentially the same vertical structures in all months of the year. The first mode, which depicts the global monsoon, has a simple vertical structure with a maximum in vertical motion at about 400 mb, divergence in the upper troposphere that is strongest at 150 mb and decays to zero amplitude above 70 mb, and convergence in the lower troposphere with a maximum at 925 mb (ECMWF) or 850 mb (NCEP). However, this mode has a rich three-dimensional spatial structure that evolves with the seasons. It accounts for 60{\%} of the annual cycle variance of the divergent mass circulation and dominates the Hadley circulation as well as three overturning transverse cells. These include the Pacific Walker circulation; an Americas\&{\#}8211;Atlantic Walker circulation, both of which comprise rising motion in the west and sinking in the east; and a transverse cell over Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and the Indian Ocean that has rising motion in the east and sinking toward the west. These exist year-round but migrate and evolve considerably with the seasons and have about a third to half of the mass flux of the peak Hadley cell. The annual cycle of the two Hadley cells reveals peak strength in early February and early August in both reanalyses. A second monsoon mode, which accounts for 20{\%} of the variance, features relatively shallow but vigorous overturning with the maximum vertical velocities near 800 mb, outflow from 750 to 350 mb, and inflow peaking at 925 mb. It is especially strong over Africa where the shallow, mostly meridional overturning migrates back and forth across the equator with the seasons. It influences the Middle East, has a signature over Australia, and is also an important component of the overturning in the tropical eastern Pacific and Atlantic, and thus of the convergence zones in these regions. The relationship of the global monsoon to the regional monsoons is described over six zonal sectors: Africa, Australia\&{\#}8211;Asia, North America, South America, and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Only the two ocean areas do not undergo a seasonal reversal required for monsoons, although they have direct overturning cells and they nevertheless participate in the global monsoon through the changes in large-scale overturning. The regional meridional cross sections highlight the importance of the shallow overturning cell in lower-troposphere monsoon activity. The steadiness of the overturning circulation is determined by comparing the signal of the seasonal mean vertical motions at 500 mb with the standard deviation of the transient daily variations. Locations where this signal exceeds 60{\%} of the daily noise correspond closely with the regional centers of the monsoon. },

The land model, known as LM2, includes soil sensible and latent heat storage, groundwater storage, and stomatal resistance. The performance of the coupled model AM2\&{\#}8211;LM2 is evaluated with a series of prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) simulations. Particular focus is given to the model's climatology and the characteristics of interannual variability related to E1 Ni\~no\&{\#}8211; Southern Oscillation (ENSO).One AM2\&{\#}8211;LM2 integration was performed according to the prescriptions of the second Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP II) and data were submitted to the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI). Particular strengths of AM2\&{\#}8211;LM2, as judged by comparison to other models participating in AMIP II, include its circulation and distributions of precipitation. Prominent problems of AM2\&{\#}8211; LM2 include a cold bias to surface and tropospheric temperatures, weak tropical cyclone activity, and weak tropical intraseasonal activity associated with the Madden\&{\#}8211;Julian oscillation.An ensemble of 10 AM2\&{\#}8211;LM2 integrations with observed SSTs for the second half of the twentieth century permits a statistically reliable assessment of the model's response to ENSO.

	Abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of trade wind cumulus clouds are conducted for clean and polluted aerosol conditions and at a number of different grid sizes to explore (1) the microphysical and morphological responses of fields of cumulus to aerosol perturbations and (2) the robustness of these responses to resolution. Cloud size distributions are shown to be well approximated by a negative power law function indicating that as resolution increases, more and more small clouds are resolved. Cloud fraction in the highest-resolution simulations is 30{\%} higher than in the coarse-resolution simulations. Polluted cloud populations contain higher numbers of smaller clouds than clean cloud populations. Their frequency of convection is higher and lifetimes are shorter. The polluted clouds also tend to have higher cloud-averaged liquid water contents. It is hypothesized that these responses are a result of a chain reaction set off by stronger evaporation at cloud edges in the case of polluted clouds. In all cases, the smallest clouds either dominate or contribute significantly to cloud fraction and cloud reflectance, in accord with recent satellite studies. The response of cloud fraction and liquid water path to aerosol changes is shown to be strongly dependent on the definition of what constitutes a ``cloud,''suggesting that caution be exercised before parameterizing these responses.},

	Abstract = {Detailed observations of cumulus cloud scales and processes are an essential ingredient in models that deal with (i) high spatial resolution cumulus ensembles; and (ii) parameterization of cloud radiative processes. The present investigation focuses on three aspects of the morphology of cumulus clouds: 1) the inhomogeneity as represented by the size distribution of clouds and cloud \&{\#}8220;holes,\&{\#}8221; 2) the nearest-neighbor relationships regarding their sizes and mutual distances, and 3) the scales of their clustering. Distributionwise, cloud size can best be represented by a mixture of two power laws. Clouds of diameter below 1 km have the slope parameter ranging from about 1.4 to 2.3, while larger clouds have slopes ranging from 2.1 to 4.75. Furthermore, these clouds are bifractal in nature. The break in power law and fractal dimension occurs at a size critical to the cloud-scale processes in the following sense. First, this is the cloud size that makes the largest contribution to the extent of cloud cover. Second, there are indications that this is the size at which clouds begin to modify their environment. Cloud inhomogeneities have significant impact on radiative fluxes. The size distribution of holes in the cumulus clouds studied here have a single slope power law with estimated slopes close to 3; these holes have single fractal dimensions. Furthermore, the results suggest that as the cloud field matures, there is an increase in the number and size of the inhomogeneities along with increasing cloud size. Nearest-neighbor relationships are studied from two different perspectives. First, the nearest-neighbor separation distance is modeled by four probability distributions: lognormal, gamma, extreme-value and Weibull. Lognormal appears to provide the best fit. Second, the nearest-neighbor pair sizes and the associated separation distance are studied using a co-occurrence frequency approach of spatial point processes using second-order statistics. The largest frequency of nearest-neighbor pairs occurs at a distance of 200\&{\#}8211;300 m, with the largest absolute differences in cloud size found at separations of about 500 m. At larger separations, there is a tendency for the larger clouds to be closer to other large clouds, apparently through the modification of the environment. Nonlinear dependence between the sizes of nearest-neighbor cloud pairs increases with increasing cloud size. Cumulus cloud clustering scales are determined by using the classical Greig-Smith quadrat analysis technique. Clustering scales of about 15, 29, and 59 km are found for most of the ten cloud fields studied. },

@article{Rodts:2003,
	Abstract = {In this paper aircraft observations of shallow cumulus over Florida during the Small Cumulus Microphysics Study (SCMS) are analyzed. Size distributions of cloud fraction, mass flux, and in-cloud buoyancy flux are derived. These distributions provide information on the specific contribution of clouds with a certain horizontal size and reveal, for example, which size has the largest effect on cloud fraction or vertical transport. The analysis of four flights shows that the mass flux and buoyancy flux are dominated by intermediate-sized clouds (horizontal dimension of about 1 km). The cloud fraction, on the other hand, is found to be dominated by the smallest clouds observed. These clouds are additionally found to have a negative contribution to the mass flux, yet a positive contribution to the buoyancy flux. About 200 flight intersections of cumuli with horizontal sizes larger than 500 m are used to obtain average horizontal cross-section profiles of vertical velocity, liquid water content, liquid water potential temperature, and virtual potential temperature. A thin shell of descending air just around the cloud emerges as a conspicuous feature. Evidence is found that the descent is mainly caused by evaporative cooling, which results from lateral mixing at the cloud boundary. A Landsat satellite image near the flight region is analyzed to compare the cloud size distributions with the aircraft data. The cloud cover in the image appears to be dominated by much larger clouds than the aircraft observations indicated. To account for the different measurement methodology (two-dimensional versus one-dimensional) an equation with which one can predict the cloud size distribution that results from performing line measurements in a prescribed two-dimensional cumulus field is derived. The equation reveals that the aircraft cloud size distributions are always biased toward smaller cloud sizes. This effect is nevertheless not enough to reconcile the aircraft and satellite data, presumably because the analysis neglects the variability of clouds in the vertical direction. },

	Abstract = {This study uses a number of data sets (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator data, space shuttle photography, Radiation Measurement System data, aircraft data, and shipboard soundings) to investigate the characteristics of small tropical cumulus clouds and their impact on their environment. The goal is to uncover useful information with application to radiative transfer simulation and satellite remote sensing. In fields of small cumulus clouds, size distributions are found to decrease in number with increasing diameter according to a double power law relation, often with a clear break diameter. Fractal dimensions corresponding to the horizontal area and perimeter of the clouds are greater for the larger clouds than for the smaller clouds, with the same break diameter as the size distributions, meaning that the larger clouds have more ragged perimeters. These two results suggest a characteristic horizontal length scale dividing larger and smaller boundary layer cumuli. Spatial distributions show a clear tendency toward clustering. Smaller cumuli appear to grow upward more quickly with increasing horizontal size than do larger cumuli. Albedo is found to increase with greater cloud fraction and higher solar zenith angle. Even sparse fields of small cumulus cause significant shortwave forcing at the ocean surface. Simulation suggests that small cumulus may introduce significant errors into sea surface temperature retrievals and that such clouds can be difficult to remove with operational cloud-filtering schemes. Clouds smaller than about 1 km in diameter are not seen to precipitate.},

	Abstract = {Cloud size distributions of shallow cumulus cloud populations are calculated using the large-eddy simulation (LES) approach. A range of different cases is simulated, and the results are compared to observations of real cloud populations. Accordingly, the same algorithm is applied as in observational studies using high-altitude photography or remote sensing. The cloud size density of the simulated cloud populations is described well by a power law at the smaller sizes. This scaling covers roughly one order of magnitude of cloud sizes, with a power-law exponent of \&{\#}8722;1.70, which is comparable to exponents found in observational studies. A sensitivity test for the resolution suggests that the scaling continues at sizes smaller than the standard grid spacing. In contrast, on the other end, the scaling region is bounded by a distinct scale break. When the cloud size is nondimensionalized by the scale break size, the cloud size densities of all cases collapse. This corroborates the idea of a universal description for the whole cloud size density, with the scale break size as the only variable. The intermediate dominating size in the cloud fraction and mass flux decompositions is directly related to the presence of the scale break in the cloud size density. Despite their large number, the smallest clouds contribute very little to the total vertical mass transport. The intermediate size of the dominating clouds in the cloud fraction and mass flux is insensitive to the resolution of LES. },

	Abstract = {Feedbacks involving low-level clouds remain a primary cause of uncertainty in global climate model projections. This issue was addressed by examining changes in low-level clouds over the Northeast Pacific in observations and climate models. Decadal fluctuations were identified in multiple, independent cloud data sets, and changes in cloud cover appeared to be linked to changes in both local temperature structure and large-scale circulation. This observational analysis further indicated that clouds act as a positive feedback in this region on decadal time scales. The observed relationships between cloud cover and regional meteorological conditions provide a more complete way of testing the realism of the cloud simulation in current-generation climate models. The only model that passed this test simulated a reduction in cloud cover over much of the Pacific when greenhouse gases were increased, providing modeling evidence for a positive low-level cloud feedback. },

	Abstract = {This study investigates the physical mechanism of low cloud feedback in the Community Atmospheric Model, version 3 (CAM3) through idealized single-column model (SCM) experiments over the subtropical eastern oceans. Negative cloud feedback is simulated from stratus and stratocumulus that is consistent with previous diagnostics of cloud feedbacks in CAM3 and its predecessor versions. The feedback occurs through the interaction of a suite of parameterized processes rather than from any single process. It is caused by the larger amount of in-cloud liquid water in stratus clouds from convective sources, and longer lifetimes of these clouds in a warmer climate through their interaction with boundary layer turbulence. Thermodynamic effects are found to dominate the negative cloud feedback in the model. The dynamic effect of weaker subsidence in a warmer climate also contributes to the negative cloud feedback, but with about one-quarter of the magnitude of the thermodynamic effect, owing to increased low-level convection in a warmer climate. },

@article{DiGirolamo:1997,
	Abstract = {The standard method of deriving cloud fraction from space simply finds the fraction of total image pixels that contains some cloud. The sensitivity of this method to sensor resolution has been examined by Shenk and Salomonson {$[$}1972{$]$}, assuming the cloudy pixels are detected perfectly. Their experiment is reexamined to show that the sensitivity is much more complex than they predicted. We derive the upper and lower bounds of the true cloud fraction, At            , given the standard method estimate, Ae            , to show that the range of possible values for At             can be, in general, very wide. By including the fraction of apparent cloud edge and cloud interior pixels, the bounds can be reduced and improvements to the standard method can be obtained. However, this improvement is also resolution limited by the misidentification of partially cloudy pixels as cloud interior rather than cloud edge. A potentially better technique for estimating the true cloud fraction is therefore explored using a pattern recognition approach. A nearest neighbor classification rule is used in two sets of experiments: one using 684 simulated cloud fields as a training set, the other using 370 cloud fields based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) measurements. Given the underlying distribution of At            , Ae             overestimates At             with an overall average bias of 32{\%} and standard error of 11{\%} for the simulated training set, and a bias of 35{\%} and a standard error of 3{\%} for the AVHRR training set. The pattern recognition estimate, Ap            , is essentially unbiased and has a standard error of 12{\%} for both training sets. The relevance of these training sets to new scenes and the importance of imperfect cloud detection have yet to be investigated, but the pattern recognition technique shows considerable potential advantage over the standard technique in providing unbiased estimates of cloud fraction that are less sensitive to the effects of sensor resolution.},

	Abstract = {Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data are used to provide a very high spatial resolution source of cloud ``truth.''TM atmospheric window channels at wavelengths of 0.83 and 11.5 μm are used to simulate the visible and infrared channels on meteorological satellites. The TM data are spatially averaged to provide spatial resolutions (that is, pixel sizes) ranging from the full resolution 28.5-m data to the 1-, 4-, and 8-km resolutions typical of AVHRR and GOES data. These data are then used to examine the sensitivity of satellite-derived estimates of cloud fractional coverage to changing sensor spatial resolution. Seven different cloud retrieval algorithms are examined, including the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), new cloud for Earth (NCLE) radiation budget, hybrid bispectral threshold method (HBTM), spatial coherence, box counting based on fractal theory, reflectance threshold, and temperature threshold methods. The analysis is carried out for 24 cloud fields of varying cloud type: cumulus, stratocumulus, altocumulus, cirrus, and multilayered cloud. Results indicate that estimates of cloud fraction vary greatly as a function of sensor spatial resolution and cloud algorithm assumptions. Even for 28.5-m spatial resolution data, current cloud algorithms give cloud fractions that vary by as much as 0.25. In general, cloud algorithms are sensitive to either sensor resolution (threshold methods such as ISCCP or HBTM) or to assumptions about cloud optical depth (NCLE, spatial coherence). When present, the effect of sensor resolution is small for satellite pixel sizes less than 0.25 km. The effects are large for pixel sizes of 1 km or larger. Results are shown to be a strong function of cloud type. The effect of sensor resolution is strongest for boundary layer clouds and is very weak for cirrus clouds. At the 4- to 8-km spatial resolutions typical of meteorological satellite data, the ISCCP algorithm overestimates cloud fraction for boundary layer cloud by about 0.05 but underestimates thin cirrus by 0.05. The NCLE algorithm underestimates all cloud types by an average of 0.32, and spatial coherence underestimates boundary layer cloud fraction an average of 0.18. For boundary layer clouds the errors are traced to the assumption of cloud-filled pixels for ISCCP, the assumption of optically thick clouds for spatial coherence, and the assumption of a typical cloud albedo for the NCLE method. Using 8-km data, the HBTM and ISCCP methods provide the most accurate cloud fraction, although the HBTM method underestimates thin cirrus by 0.20 and ISCCP overestimates all cloud types but cirrus by about 0.05. The 24 cloud fields examined were chosen to explore some of the more difficult cloud retrieval cases, so the results should not be extrapolated to global average conditions. Nevertheless, the results suggest a critical need for a clearer understanding of the performance of satellite-derived cloud properties.},

Intriguingly, SP-CAM shows substantial low cloud increases over the subtropical oceans in the warmer climate. The paper aims to understand the mechanism for these increases.<br />The subtropical low cloud increase is analyzed by sorting grid-column months of the climate model into composite cloud regimes using percentile ranges of lower tropospheric stability (LTS).  LTS is observed to be well correlated to subtropical low cloud amount and boundary layer vertical structure. The low cloud increase in SP-CAM is attributed to boundary-layer destabilization due to increased clear-sky radiative cooling in the warmer climate.  This drives more shallow cumulus convection and a moister boundary layer, inducing cloud increases and further increasing the radiative cooling. The boundary layer depth does not change substantially, due to compensation between increased radiative cooling (which promotes more turbulent mixing and boundary-layer deepening) and slight strengthening of the boundary-layer top inversion (which inhibits turbulent entrainment and promotes a shallower boundary layer). The widespread changes in low clouds do not appear to be driven by changes in mean subsidence. <br />In a companion paper we use column-mode CRM simulations based on LTS-composite profiles to further study the low-cloud response mechanisms and to explore the sensitivity of low cloud response to grid resolution in SP-CAM.   <br />},

To better interpret the origin of that uncertainty, we analyze the sensitivity of the tropical cloud radiative forcing to a change in sea surface temperature that is simulated by 15 coupled models simulating climate change and current interannual variability. We show that it is in regimes of large-scale subsidence that the model results (1) differ the most in climate change and (2) disagree the most with observations in the current climate (most models underestimate the interannual sensitivity of clouds albedo to a change in temperature). This suggests that the simulation of the sensitivity of marine boundary layer clouds to changing environmental conditions constitutes, currently, the main source of uncertainty in tropical cloud feedbacks simulated by general circulation models.},

	Abstract = {Errors in the standard cloud fraction products produced by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) on EOS-Terra were examined using 15 m resolution data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Relative to 124 ASTER scenes containing only trade wind cumuli and having an average cloud fraction of 0.08, MODIS and MISR overestimated cloud fraction by 0.18 and 0.36, respectively. For non-sunglint scenes, MODIS and MISR overestimated cloud fractions by 0.02 and 0.24, respectively. Systematic dependences in the MODIS and MISR cloud fractions with ASTER cloud fraction were observed. Large RMS errors in MODIS and MISR cloud fractions were observed because of variations in the spatial distribution of clouds, suggesting it may be difficult to decouple long-term changes in cloud fraction from satellites from true changes in the spatial distribution of clouds.},

	Abstract = {This work describes a new climatology of cloud liquid water path (LWP), termed the University of Wisconsin (UWisc) climatology, derived from 18 yr of satellite-based passive microwave observations over the global oceans. The climatology is based on a modern retrieval methodology applied consistently to the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) for Earth Observing System (EOS) (AMSR-E) microwave sensors on eight different satellite platforms, beginning in 1988 and continuing through 2005. It goes beyond previously published climatologies by explicitly solving for the diurnal cycle of cloud liquid water by providing statistical error estimates, and includes a detailed discussion of possible systematic errors.A novel methodology for constructing the climatology is used in which a mean monthly diurnal cycle as well as monthly means of the liquid water path are derived simultaneously from the data on a 1{${}^\circ$} grid; the methodology also produces statistical errors for these quantities, which decrease toward the end of the time record as the number of observations increases. The derived diurnal cycles are consistent with previous findings in the tropics, but are also derived for higher latitudes and contain more information than in previous studies. The new climatology exhibits differences with previous observationally based climatologies and is found to be more consistent with the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) than are the previous climatologies.Potential systematic errors of the order of 15{\%}\&{\#}8211;30{\%} or higher exist in the LWP climatology. A previously unexplored source of systematic error is caused by the assumption that all microwave-based retrievals of LWP must make regarding the partitioning of cloud water and rainwater, which cannot be determined using microwave observations alone. The potentially large systematic errors that result may hamper the usefulness of microwave-based climatologies of both cloud liquid water and especially rain rate, particularly in certain regions of the tropics and midlatitudes where the separation of rain from liquid cloud water is most critical. },

Comparisons are made with ECMWF and MERRA analyses, GCM simulations utilized in the IPCC 4th Assessment, and three GCM simulations. There is considerable disagreement amongst the LWP estimates and amongst the modeled values. The LWP from GCMs are much larger than the observed estimates and the two analyses. The largest values in the CloudSat LWP occur over the boundary-layer stratocumulus regions; this feature is not as evident in the analyses or models. Better agreement is found between the two analyses and CloudSat LWP when cases with surface precipitation are excluded. The upward vertical extent of LWC from the GCMs and analyses is greater than CloudSat estimates. The issues of representing LWC and precipitation consistently between satellite-derived and model values are discussed.},

It is shown that the global tropical oceans (30N--30S) predominantly favor clouds with tops in two layers centered at about 2 and 12 km. Precipitating clouds occur primarily in three modes, a shallow mode that is the most frequent type, as well as a middle and deep mode. Regional features are also discussed. The Indian and western Pacific Oceans exhibit more predominantly high clouds and deeper precipitation features than the eastern Pacific and Atlantic. The occurrence of a mid-level mode of cloudiness and precipitation is shown to vary regionally, being particularly significant in the western Pacific. For all regions examined, precipitating clouds are observed to be deeper than non-precipitating clouds. Over the global tropical oceans, 18{\%} of the clouds detected by CloudSat produce precipitation.},

@article{Stephens:2002,
	Abstract = {CloudSat is a satellite experiment designed to measure the vertical structure of clouds from space. The expected launch of CloudSat is planned for 2004, and once launched, CloudSat will orbit in formation as part of a constellation of satellites (the A-Train) that includes NASA's Aqua and Aura satellites, a NASA\&{\#}8211;CNES lidar satellite (CALIPSO), and a CNES satellite carrying a polarimeter (PARASOL). A unique feature that CloudSat brings to this constellation is the ability to fly a precise orbit enabling the fields of view of the CloudSat radar to be overlapped with the CALIPSO lidar footprint and the other measurements of the constellation. The precision and near simultaneity of this overlap creates a unique multisatellite observing system for studying the atmospheric processes essential to the hydrological cycle. The vertical profiles of cloud properties provided by CloudSat on the global scale fill a critical gap in the investigation of feedback mechanisms linking clouds to climate. Measuring these profiles requires a combination of active and passive instruments, and this will be achieved by combining the radar data of CloudSat with data from other active and passive sensors of the constellation. This paper describes the underpinning science and general overview of the mission, provides some idea of the expected products and anticipated application of these products, and the potential capability of the A-Train for cloud observations. Notably, the CloudSat mission is expected to stimulate new areas of research on clouds. The mission also provides an important opportunity to demonstrate active sensor technology for future scientific and tactical applications. The CloudSat mission is a partnership between NASA's JPL, the Canadian Space Agency, Colorado State University, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Department of Energy. },

@article{Roeckner:2006,
	Abstract = {The most recent version of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology atmospheric general circulation model, ECHAM5, is used to study the impact of changes in horizontal and vertical resolution on seasonal mean climate. In a series of Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)-style experiments with resolutions ranging between T21L19 and T159L31, the systematic errors and convergence properties are assessed for two vertical resolutions. At low vertical resolution (L19) there is no evidence for convergence to a more realistic climate state for horizontal resolutions higher than T42. At higher vertical resolution (L31), on the other hand, the root-mean-square errors decrease monotonically with increasing horizontal resolution. Furthermore, except for T42, the L31 versions are superior to their L19 counterparts, and the improvements become more evident at increasingly higher horizontal resolutions. This applies, in particular, to the zonal mean climate state and to the stationary wave patterns in boreal winter. As in previous studies, increasing horizontal resolution leads to a warming of the troposphere, most prominently at midlatitudes, and to a poleward shift and intensification of the midlatitude westerlies. Increasing the vertical resolution has the opposite effect, almost independent of horizontal resolution. Whereas the atmosphere is colder at low and middle latitudes, it is warmer at high latitudes and close to the surface. In addition, increased vertical resolution results in a pronounced warming in the polar upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, where the cold bias is reduced by up to 50{\%} compared to L19 simulations. Consistent with these temperature changes is a decrease and equatorward shift of the midlatitude westerlies. The substantial benefits in refining both horizontal and vertical resolution give some support to scaling arguments deduced from quasigeostrophic theory implying that horizontal and vertical resolution ought to be chosen consistently. },

	Abstract = {The results of some calculations with a zonally symmetric version of the Goddard Laboratory of Atmospheric Sciences (GLAS) climate model are described. The model was first used to study the nature of symmetric circulation in response to various zonally-averaged latent heating fields based on observations. Three experiments with distribution of Intent beating corresponding to the equinox condition, Northern Hemisphere summer condition and south Asian monsoon condition showed reasonable similarity to the observed distribution of surface easterlies and westerlies and the subtropical westerly jets. In the south Asian monsoon experiment, surface westerlies as well as the upper-level easterly jet in the subtropics of the Northern Hemisphere were found. The strength of the subtropical westerly jet increased with decrease in the vertical eddy viscosity. Additional experiments were carried out in which the model was allowed to determine its own latent beat sources and the results were analyzed to examine the interaction of CISK and the imposed SST in determining the position, structure and transient behavior of the ITCZ. In the small number of cases considered, the model equilibrium was found to be independent of initial conditions, with a narrow ITCZ occurring over the SST maximum. After the equilibrium solution was established, the specfied SST distribution was altered. It was found that the initial ITCZ persisted for a long time (weeks to months); however, finally a new ITCZ became established at the location of the new SST maximum. Initially its development was slow, but was followed by a rapid intensification toward the end. The time needed for the establishment of the ITCZ at its new position depended upon the latitude of maximum SST and the magnitude of the SST anomaly. The calculations also indicated the properties of some of the parameterizations employed in the climate model, in particular, the moist convection and the effects of clouds on radiative cooling. },

The sorting is physics-based and phenomenon-oriented. We find different degrees of clustering of cloud vertical structure in various large-scale regimes. The dominant modes are the deep and shallow clouds with peak CWC above 7 km and below 2 km, respectively, corresponding to distinctly different large-scale regimes. A middle-level peak of CWC around 5--7 km is discernible associated with the large-scale conditions similar to the shallow clouds. This study provides the first quantitative and comprehensive view of tropical CWC distributions in large-scale regimes.

	Abstract = {Links are examined between time-averaged cloud radiative properties, particularly the longwave and shortwave components of cloud radiative forcing (CRF), and properties of the long-term averages of atmospheric soundings, in particular upper-tropospheric humidity (UTH), lower-tropospheric precipitable water (PW), and static stability (SS). The joint distributions of moisture measures and the composite or conditional mean CRF for different moisture and stability combinations are computed. This expands on previous studies that have examined cloud properties versus vertical velocity and surface temperature. These computations are done for satellite observations and for three representative coupled climate models from major modeling centers.Aside from mean biases reported previously, several departures are identified between the modeled and observed joint distributions that are qualitative and significant. Namely, the joint distribution of PW and UTH is very compact in observations but less so in models, cloud forcings are tightly related to PW in the data but to UTH in the models, and strong negative net CRF in marine stratocumulus regions occurs only for high SS and low UTH in the data but violates one or both of these restrictions in each of the models.All three errors are preliminarily interpreted as symptoms of inadequate dependence of model convective development on ambient humidity above the boundary layer. In any case, the character of the errors suggests utility for model testing and future development. A set of scalar metrics for quantifying some of the problems is presented; these metrics can be easily applied to standard model output.Finally, an examination of doubled-CO2 simulations suggests that the errors noted here are significantly affecting cloud feedback in at least some models. For example, in one model a strong negative feedback is found from clouds forming in model conditions that never occur in the observations. },

Here we use CALIPSO lidar observations together with a lidar simulator to evaluate the cloudiness simulated by a climate model: modeled atmospheric profiles are converted to an ensemble of subgrid-scale attenuated backscatter lidar signals from which a cloud fraction is derived. Except in regions of persistent thick upper-level clouds, the cloud fraction diagnosed through this procedure is close to that actually predicted by the model. A fractional cloudiness is diagnosed consistently from CALIPSO data at a spatio-temporal resolution comparable to that of the model. The comparison of the model's cloudiness with CALIPSO data reveals discrepancies more pronounced than in previous model evaluations based on passive observations. This suggests that space-borne lidar observations constitute a powerful tool for the evaluation of clouds in large-scale models, including marine boundary-layer clouds},

	Abstract = {Data collected in situ as part of the second field study of the Dynamics and Chemistry of Marine Stratocumulus field program are used to evaluate the state of the atmosphere in the region of field operations near 30{${}^\circ$}N, 120{${}^\circ$}W during July 2001, as well as its representation by a variety of routinely available data. The routine data include both the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) and NCEP\&{\#}8211;NCAR reanalyses, forecasts from their respective forecast systems (the Integrated and Global Forecast Systems), the 30-km archive from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), the Quick Scatterometer surface winds, and remotely sensed fields derived from radiances measured by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer. The analysis shows that outside of the boundary layer the state of the lower troposphere is reasonably represented by the reanalysis and forecast products, with the caveat of a slight warm bias at 850 hPa in the NCEP\&{\#}8211;NCAR products. Within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) the agreement is not as good: both the boundary layer depth and cloud amount are underpredicted, and the boundary layer temperature correlates poorly with the available data, which may be related to a poor representation of SSTs in this region of persistent cloud cover. ERA-40 also suffers from persistently weak zonal winds within the PBL. Among the satellite records the ISCCP data are found to be especially valuable, evincing skill in both predicting boundary layer depth (from cloud-top temperatures and TMI surface temperatures) and cloud liquid water paths (from cloud optical depths). An analysis of interannual variability (among Julys) based on ERA-40 and the 1983\&{\#}8211;2001 ISCCP record suggests that thermodynamic quantities show similar interannual and synoptic variability, principally concentrated just above the PBL, while dynamic quantities vary much more on synoptic time scales. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that the correlation between stratocumulus cloud amount and lower-tropospheric stability exhibits considerable spatial structure and is less pronounced than previously thought. },

	Abstract = {The tropospheric response to midlatitude SST anomalies has been investigated through a series of aquaplanet simulations using a high-resolution version of the Hadley Centre atmosphere model (HadAM3) under perpetual equinox conditions.Model integrations show that increases in the midlatitude SST gradient generally lead to stronger storm tracks that are shifted slightly poleward, consistent with changes in the lower-tropospheric baroclinicity. The large-scale atmospheric response is, however, highly sensitive to the position of the SST gradient anomaly relative to that of the subtropical jet in the unperturbed atmosphere. In particular, when SST gradients are increased very close to the subtropical jet, then the Hadley cell and subtropical jet is strengthened while the storm track and eddy-driven jet are shifted equatorward. Conversely, if the subtropical SST gradients are reduced and the midlatitude gradients increased, then the storm track shows a strong poleward shift and a well-separated eddy-driven jet is produced. The sign of the SST anomaly is shown to play a secondary role in determining the overall tropospheric response.These findings are used to provide a new and consistent interpretation of some previous GCM studies concerning the atmospheric response to midlatitude SST anomalies. },

	Abstract = {ERA-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from September 1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many institutions. The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late 1980s. The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period. It also describes the data assimilation system used for ERA-40. This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized.A number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the marked improvement that was made to the observing system for the southern hemisphere in the 1970s, particularly towards the end of the decade. In contrast, the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the medium range for all years. Two particular problems are also examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans and a too strong Brewer-Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced in later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized. Expectations that the lsquosecond-generationrsquo ERA-40 re-analysis would provide products that are better than those from the firstgeneration ERA-15 and NCEP/NCAR re-analyses are found to have been met in most cases. },

@article{Webb:2001,
	Abstract = {Abstract~~ This study compares radiative fluxes and cloudiness fields from three general circulation models (the HadAM4 version of the Hadley Centre Unified model, cycle 16r2 of the ECMWF model and version LMDZ 2.0 of the LMD GCM), using a combination of satellite observations from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). To facilitate a meaningful comparison with the ISCCP C1 data, values of column cloud optical thickness and cloud top pressure are diagnosed from the models in a manner consistent with the satellite view from space. Decomposing the cloud radiative effect into contributions from low-medium- and high-level clouds reveals a tendency for the models' low-level clouds to compensate for underestimates in the shortwave cloud radiative effect caused by a lack of high-level or mid-level clouds. The low clouds fail to compensate for the associated errors in the longwave. Consequently, disproportionate errors in the longwave and shortwave cloud radiative effect in models may be taken as an indication that compensating errors are likely to be present. Mid-level cloud errors in the mid-latitudes appear to depend as much on the choice of the convection scheme as on the cloud scheme. Convective and boundary layer mixing schemes require as much consideration as cloud and precipitation schemes when it comes to assessing the simulation of clouds by models. Two distinct types of cloud feedback are discussed. While there is reason to doubt that current models are able to simulate potential `cloud regime' type feedbacks with skill, there is hope that a model capable of simulating potential `cloud amount' type feedbacks will be achievable once the reasons for the remaining differences between the models are understood. },

	Abstract = {Clouds simulated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model are composited to derive the typical organization of clouds surrounding a midlatitude baroclinic system. Comparison of this composite of about 200 cyclones with that based on satellite data reveals that the ECMWF model quite accurately simulates the general positioning of clouds relative to a low pressure center. However, the optical depths of the model\&{\#}8217;s high/low clouds are too small/large relative to the satellite observations, and the model lacks the midlevel topped clouds observed to the west of the surface cold front.Sensitivity studies with the ECMWF model reveal that the error in high-cloud optical depths is more sensitive to the assumptions applied to the ice microphysics than to the inclusion of cloud advection or a change of horizontal resolution from 0.5625{${}^\circ$} to 1.69{${}^\circ$} lat. This reflects the fact that in the ECMWF model gravitational settling is the most rapid process controlling the abundance of ice in the high clouds of midlatitude cyclones. These results underscore the need for careful evaluation of the parameterizations of microphysics and radiative properties applied to ice in large-scale models. },

	Abstract = {This progress report on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) describes changes made to produce new cloud data products (D data), examines the evidence that these changes are improvements over the previous version (C data), summarizes some results, and discusses plans for the ISCCP through 2005. By late 1999 all datasets will be available for the period from July 1983 through December 1997. The most significant changes in the new D-series cloud datasets are 1) revised radiance calibrations to remove spurious changes in the long-term record, 2) increased cirrus detection sensitivity over land, 3) increased low-level cloud detection sensitivity in polar regions, 4) reduced biases in cirrus cloud properties using an ice crystal microphysics model in place of a liquid droplet microphysics model, and 5) increased detail about the variations of cloud properties. The ISCCP calibrations are now the most complete and self-consistent set of calibrations available for all the weather satellite imaging radiometers: total relative uncertainties in the radiance calibrations are estimated to be \&{\#}8818;5{\%} for visible and \&{\#}8818;2{\%} for infrared; absolute uncertainties are < 10{\%} and < 3{\%}, respectively. Biases in (detectable) cloud amounts have been reduced to \&{\#}8818;0.05, except in the summertime polar regions where the bias may still be \&{\#}8764;0.10. Biases in cloud-top temperatures have been reduced to \&{\#}8818;2 K for lower-level clouds and \&{\#}8818;4 K for optically thin, upper-level clouds, except when they occur over lower-level clouds. Using liquid and ice microphysics models reduces the biases in cloud optical thicknesses to \&{\#}8818;10{\%}, except in cases of mistaken phase identification; most of the remaining bias is caused by differences between actual and assumed cloud particle sizes and the small effects of cloud variations at scales < 5km. Global mean cloud properties averaged over the period July 1983\&{\#}8211;June 1994 are the following: cloud amount = 0.675 {$\pm$} 0.012; cloud-top temperature = 261.5 {$\pm$} 2.8 K; and cloud optical thickness = 3.7 {$\pm$} 0.3, where the plus\&{\#}8211;minus values are the rms deviations of global monthly mean values from their long-term average. Long-term, seasonal, synoptic, and diurnal cloud variations are illustrated. The ISCCP dataset quantifies the variations of cloud properties at mesoscale resolution (3 h, 30 km) covering the whole globe for more than a decade, making it possible to study cloud system evolution over whole life cycles, watching interactions with the atmospheric general circulation. Plans for the next decade of the World Climate Research Programme require continuing global observations of clouds and the most practical way to fulfill this requirement is to continue ISCCP until it can be replaced by a more capable system with similar time resolutions and global coverage. },

Eight weeks of nearly continuous S-band polarimetric radar sampling, 57 flights from three heavily instrumented research aircraft, and a suite of ground- and ship-based instrumentation provided data on trade wind clouds with unprecedented resolution. Observational strategies employed during RICO capitalized on the advances in remote sensing and other instrumentation to provide insight into processes that span a range of scales and that lie at the heart of questions relating to the cause and effects of rain from shallow maritime cumuli. },

	Abstract = {In this study, the midlatitude cloud fields produced by a climate (GISS) and a weather (ECMWF) model are evaluated against satellite observations. Monthly ensembles of model cloud property distributions for the four seasons are compared with similar ensembles from satellite retrievals. The weather model is run in both forecast and {\^a}climate{\^a}mode in order to evaluate the importance of the exact representation of the atmospheric conditions in these ensemble comparisons. The weather and climate models are evaluated at different resolutions that cover the range used in today's climate and weather prediction simulations. Cloud property evaluations are separated into broadly defined dynamic regimes that cover the range of large-scale midlatitude motions. Quantitative evaluation tables are produced that rank the performance of the different model versions used in the study. The evaluation analysis reveals several common features between the two models. Those are the overestimation of cloud optical depth in all dynamic regimes, the underestimation of cloud cover in the large-scale descent regime and the underestimation of cloud top height in the large-scale descent regime. It is also shown that, in the radiative balance calculations, the models compensate for the overestimation of cloud optical depth through the underprediction of cloud cover. The comparison of the forecast and {\^a}climate{\^a}runs of the ECMWF model shows remarkably similar statistical properties of the clouds in the two runs. The analysis of runs with different resolutions reveals large improvement when going from a 4{\^A}$\,^{\circ}${\~A}5{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$9-layer to a 2{\^A}$\,^{\circ}${\~A}2.5{\^A}$\,^{\circ}$32-layer run with the GISS GCM, much of which is caused by the increase in vertical resolution. A comparison of a T42 and a T106 run of the same vertical resolution with the ECMWF GCM does not show considerable differences between the two model versions.},

@article{Williams:2007,
	Abstract = {Abstract~~The radiative feedback from clouds remains the largest source of variation in climate sensitivity amongst general circulation models (GCMs). A cloud clustering methodology is applied to six contemporary GCMs in order to provide a detailed intercomparison and evaluation of the simulated cloud regimes. By analysing GCMs in the context of cloud regimes, processes related to particular cloud types are more likely to be evaluated. In this paper, the mean properties of the global cloud regimes are evaluated, and the cloud response to climate change is analysed in the cloud-regime framework. Most of the GCMs are able to simulate the principal cloud regimes, however none of the models analysed have a good representation of trade cumulus in the tropics. The models also share a difficulty in simulating those regimes with cloud tops at mid-levels, with only ECHAM5 producing a regime of tropical cumulus congestus. Optically thick, high top cloud in the extra-tropics, typically associated with the passage of frontal systems, is simulated considerably too frequently in the ECHAM5 model. This appears to be a result of the cloud type persisting in the model after the meteorological conditions associated with frontal systems have ceased. The simulation of stratocumulus in the MIROC GCMs is too extensive, resulting in the tropics being too reflective. Most of the global-mean cloud response to doubled CO2 in the GCMs is found to be a result of changes in the cloud radiative properties of the regimes, rather than changes in the relative frequency of occurrence (RFO) of the regimes. Most of the variance in the global cloud response between the GCMs arises from differences in the radiative response of frontal cloud in the extra-tropics and from stratocumulus cloud in the tropics. This variance is largely the result of excessively high RFOs of specific regimes in particular GCMs. It is shown here that evaluation and subsequent improvement in the simulation of the present-day regime properties has the potential to reduce the variance of the global cloud response, and hence climate sensitivity, amongst GCMs. For the ensemble of models considered in this study, the use of observations of the mean present-day cloud regimes suggests a potential reduction in the range of climate sensitivity of almost a third. },

	Abstract = {{The effect of variations in planetary boundary layer (PBL) height on a
   GCM was investigated using the Yonsei University (YONU) AGCM. This GCM
   assumes a convective boundary layer constrained to the two lowest model
   levels. As a consequence of this fixed PBL height, the model tends to
   produce excessive mixing. In this study the authors focuse on the
   impact of spatially and temporally varying PBL height. In addition to
   stability-dependent eddy diffusivity, the model adopts both bulk mixing
   due to the surface heat flux and z-less mixing under stable conditions.
   The variable-depth PBL strongly suppressed excessive mixing so that the
   model bias was reduced over stable regions such as the Antarctic
   continent. On the other hand, vertical mixing over continents in the
   summer hemisphere was stronger than for the fixed-PBL version,
   resulting in greater rising motion and warming effects in the lower
   atmosphere. The variable-PBL height reduces excess precipitation over
   the western Pacific and East Asian monsoon region. Based on the
   improved PBL parameterization, widespread decreases in surface sensible
   heat flux and rising motion in the lower troposphere occurred
   simultaneously over the East Asian continent. This implies that
   simulation is very sensitive to PBL processes.}},

	Abstract = {{The convective planetary boundary layer (PBL) integrates surface fluxes
   and conditions over regional and diurnal scales. As a result, the
   structure and evolution of the PBL contains information directly
   related to land surface states. To examine the nature and magnitude of
   land-atmosphere coupling and the interactions and feedbacks controlling
   PBL development, the authors used a large sample of radiosonde
   observations collected at the southern Atmospheric Research Measurement
   Program-Great Plains Cloud and Radiation Testbed (ARM-CART) site in
   association with simulations of mixed-layer growth from a single-column
   PBL/land surface model. The model accurately predicts PBL evolution and
   realistically simulates thermodynamics associated with two key controls
   on PBL growth: atmospheric stability and soil moisture. The information
   content of these variables and their influence on PBL height and
   screen-level temperature can be characterized using statistical methods
   to describe PBL-land surface coupling over a wide range of conditions.
   Results also show that the first-order effects of land-atmosphere
   coupling are manifested in the control of soil moisture and stability
   on atmospheric demand for evapotranspiration and on the surface energy
   balance. Two principal land-atmosphere feedback regimes observed during
   soil moisture drydown periods are identified that complicate direct
   relationships between PBL and land surface properties, and, as a
   result, limit the accuracy of uncoupled land surface and traditional
   PBL growth models. In particular, treatments for entrainment and the
   role of the residual mixed layer are critical to quantifying diurnal

   densities (VCDs) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the Ozone Monitoring
   Instrument (OMI) to coincident tropospheric columns retrieved from the
   Concurrent Multiaxis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy
   (CMAX-DOAS) instrument, installed at the University of Leicester (52.38
   degrees N, 1.08 degrees W), and in situ near-surface measurements from
   chemiluminescence detectors. The results show that tropospheric NO2
   columns retrieved from CMAX-DOAS and OMI correlate well (r = 0.64) when
   cloud clearing has been applied, and only those pixels that sample at
   least 90\% of the Leicester area were included in the analyses. The
   correlation of OMI tropospheric VCDs with near-surface measurements for
   cloud-free days in 2005 and 2006 initially showed a strong positive
   bias in the near-surface NO2 measurements and scattered points. This
   was interpreted as being due to the satellite footprint of OMI sampling
   the NO2 sources from the surrounding area of Leicester as well as
   emissions from the city. A field-of-view (FOV) weighted estimate for
   the OMI-equivalent urban NO2 was calculated for each coincidence by
   including background concentrations from a nearby in situ monitor,
   situated in a rural area. The subsequent agreement between the OMI
   tropospheric VCDs and FOV weighted near-surface measurements is very
   good for spring (r = 0.83) and summer (r = 0.64) months. Finally,
   seasonal and weekly cycles of NO2 are produced which show that OMI may
   be underestimating the amount of NO2 during the winter months. However,
   all sets of data show expected weekly cycles, with lower values on a

@article{Guo:2007,
	Abstract = {{The Active Tracer High-Resolution Atmospheric Model is used to examine
   the aerosol indirect effect (AIE) for a spring continental stratus
   cloud on the basis of data collected during the 17 May 2003 Aerosol
   Intensive Operation Period (AIOP) at the Atmospheric Radiation
   Measurement ( ARM) Program Southern Great Plains site. Model results
   for our base case, which uses observed aerosol concentrations, agree
   reasonably well with the available observations, giving confidence that
   the basic model is reasonable. Sensitivity tests are performed to
   explore the response of the clouds to changes in the aerosol number
   concentration and surface fluxes. During the major part of the
   simulation, from 0630 through 1400 local standard time ( LST), an
   increase in the aerosol number concentration ( Na) results in a
   decrease of the mean cloud droplet size and an increase of the cloud
   liquid water path ( LWP) until aerosol number concentration levels
   reach 1200 cm(-3). Further increases in aerosol concentration do not
   increase the liquid water path because the depletion of cloud water by
   precipitation is negligible above this number concentration. After 1400
   LST, the liquid water path decreases when aerosols increase as long as
   N-a < 600 cm(-3) and remains unchanged for higher aerosol
   concentrations. The decrease of LWP is associated with the evaporative
   cooling below cloud base which leads to more condensation of water
   vapor, a result that is consistent with afternoon satellite
   observations of the response of continental clouds to increases in
   droplet concentrations. A sensitivity test with a stronger surface
   latent flux increases both the cloud geometrical thickness and cloud
   water content. On the other hand, a sensitivity test with a stronger
   surface sensible heat flux leads to a higher cloud base and a shallower
   and drier cloud. The response of the cloud geometrical thickness to
   changes in surface sensible heat flux dominates that of the cloud water
   content. The cloud fraction is also reduced at the end of the
   simulation time period. Because the surface heat fluxes will likely
   change when aerosol and droplet number concentrations change, these
   sensitivity tests show that a fully coupled simulation with a land
   surface model will be needed to fully assess the response of the cloud
   to changing aerosol concentrations. Nevertheless, since the
   thermodynamic boundary layer profiles do not change significantly when
   aerosol concentrations are changed, our results for changing aerosol
   concentrations are qualitatively correct.}},

	Abstract = {{In order to understand the driving forces for Pleistocene climate
   change more fully we need to compare the timing of climate events with
   their possible forcing. In contrast to the last interglacial (marine
   isotope stage (MIS) 5) the timing of the penultimate interglacial (MIS
   7) is poorly constrained. This study constrains its timing and
   structure by precise U-Th dating of high-resolution delta(18)O records
   from aragonite-rich Bahamian slope sediments of ODP Leg 166 (Sites 1008
   and 1009). The major glacial-interglacial cycles in delta(18)O are
   distinct within these cores and some MIS 7 substages can be identified.
   These sediments are well suited for U-Th dating because they have
   uranium concentrations of up to 12 ppm and very low initial Th-230
   contributions with most samples showing T-230/Th-232 activity ratio of
   >75, U and Th concentrations and isotope ratios were measured by
   thermal ionisation mass spectrometry and multiple collector inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry, with the latter providing
   dramatically better precision. Twenty-nine of the 41 samples measured
   have a delta(234)U value close to modern seawater suggesting that they
   have experienced little diagenesis. Ages from 27 of the 41 samples were
   deemed reliable on the basis of both their U and their Th isotope
   ratios. Ages generally increase with depth, although we see a repeated
   section of stratigraphy in one core. Extrapolation of constant
   sedimentation rate through each substage suggests that the peak of MIS
   7e lasted from similar to237 to 228 ka and that 7c began at 215 ka.
   This timing is consistent with existing low precision radiometric dates
   from speleothem deposits. The beginning of both these substages appears
   to be slightly later than in orbitally tuned timescales. The end of MIS
   7 is complex, but also appears to be somewhat later than is suggested
   by orbitally tuned timescales, although this event is not particularly
   well defined in these cores. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   compositions at submarine seeps of hydrocarbon-rich fluids ({''}cold

   concentrations (mean: 1.3 +/- 0.4 mug/g) and high delta(234)U values
   (165-317parts per thousand) of gas hydrate carbonates reflect the
   influence of sedimentary pore water indicating that these carbonates
   were formed under reducing conditions below or at the seafloor. Their
   Th-230/U-234 ages span a time interval from 0.8 to 6.4 ka and cluster
   around 1.2 and 4.7 ka. In contrast, chemoherm carbonates precipitate
   from marine bottom water marked by relatively high U concentrations
   (mean: 5.2 +/- 0.8 mug/g) and a mean delta(234)U ratio of 166 +/-
   3parts per thousand. Their U isotopes reflect the delta(234)U ratios of
   the bottom water being enriched in U-234 relative to normal seawater.
   Simple mass balance calculations based on U concentrations and their
   corresponding delta(234)U ratios reveal a contribution of about 11\% of
   sedimentary pore water to the bottom water. From the U pore water flux
   and the reconstructed U pore water concentration a mean flow rate of
   about 147 +/- 68 cm/a can be estimated. Th-230/U-234 ages of chemoherm
   carbonates range from 7.3 to 267.6 ka. Th-230/U-234 ages of two
   chemoherms (Alvin and SE-Knoll chemoherm) correspond to time intervals
   of low sealevel stands in marine isotope stages (MIS) 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and
   8. This observation indicates that fluid flow at cold seep sites
   sensitively reflects pressure changes of the hydraulic head in the
   sediments. The delta(18)O(PDB) ratios of the chemoherm carbonates
   support the hypothesis of precipitation during glacial times.
   Deviations of the chemoherm delta(18)O values from the marine

@article{Lisiecki:2005,
	Abstract = {{{[}1] We present a 5.3- Myr stack ( the `` LR04'' stack) of benthic
   delta(18)O records from 57 globally distributed sites aligned by an
   automated graphic correlation algorithm. This is the first benthic
   delta(18)O stack composed of more than three records to extend beyond
   850 ka, and we use its improved signal quality to identify 24 new
   marine isotope stages in the early Pliocene. We also present a new LR04
   age model for the Pliocene- Pleistocene derived from tuning the
   delta(18)O stack to a simple ice model based on 21 June insolation at
   65degreesN. Stacked sedimentation rates provide additional age model
   constraints to prevent overtuning. Despite a conservative tuning
   strategy, the LR04 benthic stack exhibits significant coherency with
   insolation in the obliquity band throughout the entire 5.3 Myr and in
   the precession band for more than half of the record. The LR04 stack
   contains significantly more variance in benthic delta(18) O than
   previously published stacks of the late Pleistocene as the result of
   higher-resolution records, a better alignment technique, and a greater
   percentage of records from the Atlantic. Finally, the relative phases
   of the stack's 41- and 23- kyr components suggest that the precession
   component of delta(18)O from 2.7 - 1.6 Ma is primarily a deep- water
   temperature signal and that the phase of delta(18)O precession response
   changed suddenly at 1.6 Ma.}},

	Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that nonphysical barriers to gene flow play a
   role in the divergence of low-latitude seabird populations, we applied
   phylogeographic methods to mitochondrial control region sequence
   variation in a global sample of masked boobies (Sula dactylatra). In
   accord with previous studies, we found that Indo-Pacific and Atlantic
   haplotypes form two divergent lineages, excluding one haplotype
   previously attributed to secondary contact between the Indian Ocean and
   the Caribbean Sea. Within the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic, we found a
   relatively large number of haplotypes, many of which were unique to a
   single population. Although haplotypes from most populations were found
   in more than one higher-level clade, nested clade analysis revealed a
   significant association between clades and geography for the majority
   of higher-level clades, most often interpreted as a consequence of
   isolation by distance. We found low levels of gene flow within
   Indo-Pacific and Atlantic populations, and a significant correlation
   between gene flow and geographical distance among Indo-Pacific
   populations. We estimate that Indo-Pacific masked boobies experienced
   rapid population growth similar to 180 000 years ago and that the
   majority of Indo-Pacific and Atlantic populations diverged within the
   last similar to 115 000 years. These combined data suggest that the

   long-term isolation by physical barriers to gene flow. In contrast,
   populations within these regions appear to have diverged despite few

@article{Hearty:2005,
	Abstract = {{Remnants of an extensive carbonate platform crop out along, the
   southeast coast of Kaua'i, Hawaii. A basalt flow within this succession
   has a whole-rock Ar-40/Ar-39 step-heating plateau age of 375 +/- 4 ka.
   The plateau age, which we interpret as the eruption age, indicates that
   rejuvenation volcanism persisted on Kaua'i for considerably longer (c.
   200 000 yr) than previously thought, and also that published whole-rock
   K-Ar determinations may not accurately reflect eruption ages. The
   succession of younger sedimentary deposits and age of the basalt imply
   that the eruption occurred near the end of marine isotope stage (MIS)
   11. Preservation of limestone dune assemblages and extensive paleosols
   above present-day sea level indicates that Kaua'i underwent a period of
   emergence during the early and middle Pleistocene, probably due to
   passage over the lithospheric arch or forebulge created by crustal
   loading of Maui Nui. The presence of at least eight major
   limestone-soil ``couplets{''}, together with extrapolated ages from the
   Ar-40/Ar-39 dating, make this the oldest surficial record of limestone

@article{Lewellen:1996,
	Abstract = {An investigation of the influence of the ratio of surface sensible heat flux to latent heat flux, the Bowen ratio. on the structure of boundary-layer clouds is carried out utilizing numerical large eddy simulations (LES). The role of cloud-top radiational cooling, cloud-top temperature and moisture jump conditions, and wind shear are included in a secondary way. Although no detailed comparisons have been made, the LES results appear to be qualitatively consistent with the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment, the recent field study on marine boundary-layer cloud structure. Some conclusions that follow from an examination of these LES results are the following: First, there is a highly bimodal character to the cloud ceiling frequency within a very low Bowen ratio boundary layer. The updrafts tend to produce a lower cloud ceiling than the surrounding environment with its weak downdrafts. Second, a very low Bowen ratio with the aid of some boundary-layer shear makes the development of persistent microcell cloud circulations possible within the boundary layer. Third, when the surface latent heat flux is the dominant factor in the dynamics of the boundary layer, the approach to a conditionally stable lapse rate results in the potential for subsequent decoupling. Last, the maximum partial cloud fraction is very well represented by the relation suggested by Sommeria and Deardorff for a Gaussian probability distribution for the range of conditions studied. },

In his impressive oeuvre of work over the 50-year span (1920\&{\#}8211;70), there appears a lone contribution to the geophysical sciences on the subject of evaporation and conduction from water surfaces. This theoretical development led to an expression for the ratio of heat conduction to evaporative flux at the air-water interface, labeled the Bowen ratio by Harald Sverdrup in the early 1940s. The circumstances that led to this contribution are examined with attention to the character of education and research at the California Institute of Technology during the 1920s.

The model initialization is based on observations made during the Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX). Several different sampling criteria are applied. The presence of liquid water is used to select clouds, whereas additional criteria are applied to sample cloud updraft, downdraft, and core properties. A comparison between the budgets of the mass flux and the vertical velocity variance show that they appear to be qualitatively similar. The mass flux is driven by buoyancy in the lower part of the cloud layer, whereas turbulent transport is important in generating mass flux in the upper part of the cloud layer. Pressure and subgrid-scale effects typically act to dissipate mass flux. Entrainment and detrainment rates for the vertical velocity equation are presented. They are found to be smaller in comparison to the ones for conserved variables. It is explained that the top-hat structure for the virtual potential temperature is degraded by mixing at the cloud boundaries leading to a subsequent evaporative cooling of cloud droplets that supports the formation of negatively buoyant cloud parcels.},

@article{DeRoode:2000,
	Abstract = {In many large-scale models mass-flux parameterizations are applied to prognose the effect of cumulus cloud convection on the large-scale environment. Key parameters in the mass-flux equations are the lateral entrainment and detrainment rates. The physical meaning of these parameters is that they quantify the mixing rate of mass across the thermal boundaries between the cloud and its environment. The prognostic equations for the updraft and downdraft value of a conserved variable are used to derive a prognostic variance equation in the mass-flux approach. The analogy between this equation and the Reynolds-averaged variance equation is discussed. It is demonstrated that the prognostic variance equation formulated in mass-flux variables contains a gradient-production, transport, and dissipative term. In the latter term, the sum of the lateral entrainment and detrainment rates represents an inverse timescale of the dissipation. Steady-state solutions of the variance equations are discussed. Expressions for the fractional entrainment and detrainment coefficients are derived. Also, solutions for the vertical flux of an arbitrary conserved variable are presented. For convection in which the updraft fraction equals the downdraft fraction, the vertical flux of the scalar flows down the local mean gradient. The turbulent mixing coefficient is given by the ratio of the vertical mass flux and the sum of the fractional entrainment and detrainment coefficients. For an arbitrary updraft fraction, however, flux correction terms are part of the solution. It is shown that for a convective boundary layer these correction terms can account for countergradient transport, which is illustrated from large eddy simulation results. In the cumulus convection limit the vertical flux flows down the \&{\#}8220;cloud\&{\#}8221; gradient. It is concluded that in the mass-flux approach the turbulent mixing coefficients, and the correction terms that arise from the transport term, are very similar to closures applied to the Reynolds-averaged equations.},

A main objective of this study is to obtain a quantitative assessment of the quality of the turbulent dynamics for this type of boundary layer clouds as produced by the different LES codes. A 6-h simulation shows excellent model-to-model agreement of the observed vertical thermodynamical structure, reasonable agreement of variances and turbulent fluxes, and good agreement of quantities conditionally sampled within the model clouds, such as cloud cover, liquid water, and cloud updraft strength. In the second part of this paper the LES dataset is used to evaluate simple models that are used in parameterizations of current general circulation models (GCMs).

Data were obtained from rawinsondes launched every 1{$\frac12$} hr from the four corner ships of the BOMEX array. Computations were limited to the lowest 500 mb within a 500-km square centered at 15{${}^\circ$}N, 56{${}^\circ$}30\&{\#}8242;W. The mass budget is characterized by mean, low-level divergence and downward motion. Maximum divergence (5 {$\times$} 10\&{\#}8722;6 s\&{\#}8722;1) is found approximately 80 mb above the surface and maximum subsidence near the base of the trade-wind inversion. The computed average evaporation is 6.0 mm/day. The computations show an upward flux of moisture through the trade inversion by subgrid-scale eddies, but the mean downward flux dominates, leading to a net downward transfer of moisture through the trade inversion. A surface stress of 0.065 Newtons (N)m\&{\#}8722;2 is computed from the momentum balance with the top of the friction layer approximately 130 mb above the surface. Computed frictional loss of grid-scale kinetic energy within the boundary layer is 0.8 Wm\&{\#}8722;2. Heat balance computations indicate a Bowen ratio of approximately 0.1. Comparison of profiles of subgrid-scale moisture flux and nonradiative diabatic heating suggests that condensation and evaporation processes associated with the development and dissipation of trade-wind cumulus can make a significant contribution to the heat balance of the cloud and trade inversion layers. },

@article{Randall:2003b,
	Abstract = {A key factor limiting the reliability of simulations of anthropogenic climate change is the inability to accurately represent the various effects of clouds on climate. Despite the best efforts of the community, the problem has resisted solution for several decades. The reasons for this are briefly reviewed and it is argued that it will be many more decades before the problem can be solved through the approaches to cloud parameterization that have been used up to now. An alternative approach, called superparameterization, is then outlined, in which high-resolution cloud system\&{\#}8211;resolving models (CSRMs) are used in place of the conventional cloud parameterizations. Tests performed with the Community Atmosphere Model show that superparameterizations can give more realistic simulations of the current climate, including greatly improved simulations of the Madden\&{\#}8211;Julian oscillation and other tropical wave disturbances. Superparameterizations increase the cost of climate simulation by a factor of several hundred dollars, but can make efficient use of massively parallel computers. In addition, superparameterizations make it possible for a climate model to converge to a global CSRM as the horizontal grid spacing of the climate model decreases to a few kilometers. No existing global atmospheric model has this convergence property. Superparameterizations have the potential to greatly increase the reliability of climate change simulations. },

	Abstract = {A new parameterization of shallow cumulus convection is presented. The parameterization consists of a mass flux scheme based on a buoyancy-sorting, entrainment\&{\#}8211;detrainment plume model. The mass flux scheme is coupled to a 1.5-order turbulence closure model with an entrainment closure for convective boundary layers. Model performance is verified using single-column-model simulations at relatively high vertical resolution of pure trade-cumulus convection and a cumulus to stratocumulus transition. Mixing rates, cloud cover, and vertical flux profiles, as deduced from previously published large-eddy simulation studies, are well reproduced by the parameterization. The model is used to demonstrate that height variations of lateral mixing rates can be successfully captured by a simple implementation of a buoyancy-sorting mechanism in the updraft cloud model. A companion paper describes the implementation of the scheme in a mesoscale model. },

Multiple linear regression is used to relate the radiation budget data to the cloud data. Comparing cloud forcing estimates obtained from the ISCCP-ERBE regression with those derived from the ERBE scene identification shows generally good agreement except over snow, in tropical convective regions, and in regions that are either nearly cloudless or always overcast. It is suggested that a substantial fraction of the disagreement in longwave cloud forcing in tropical convective regions is associated with the fact that the ERBE scene identification does not take into account variations in upper-tropospheric water vapor. On a global average basis, low clouds make the largest contribution to the net energy balance of the earth, because they cover such a large area and because their albedo effect dominates their effect on emitted thermal radiation. High, optically thick clouds can also very effectively reduce the energy balance, however, because their very high albedos overcome their low emission temperatures.},

	Abstract = {The joint probability density function (PDF) of vertical velocity and conserved scalars is important for at least two reasons. First, the shape of the joint PDF determines the buoyancy flux in partly cloudy layers. Second, the PDF provides a wealth of information about subgrid variability and hence can serve as the foundation of a boundary layer cloud and turbulence parameterization. This paper analyzes PDFs of stratocumulus, cumulus, and clear boundary layers obtained from both aircraft observations and large eddy simulations. The data are used to fit five families of PDFs: a double delta function, a single Gaussian, and three PDF families based on the sum of two Gaussians. Overall, the double Gaussian, that is binormal, PDFs perform better than the single Gaussian or double delta function PDFs. In cumulus layers with low cloud fraction, the improvement occurs because typical PDFs are highly skewed, and it is crucial to accurately represent the tail of the distribution, which is where cloud occurs. Since the double delta function has been shown in prior work to be the PDF underlying mass-flux schemes, the data analysis herein hints that mass-flux simulations may be improved upon by using a parameterization built upon a more realistic PDF.},

The methodology behind the model is the so-called assumed probability density function (PDF) method. The parameterization differs from higher-order closure or mass-flux schemes in that it achieves closure by the use of a relatively sophisticated joint PDF of vertical velocity, temperature, and moisture. A family of PDFs is chosen that is flexible enough to represent various cloudiness regimes. A double Gaussian family proposed by previous works is used. Predictive equations for grid box means and a number of higher-order turbulent moments are advanced in time. These moments are in turn used to select a particular member from the family of PDFs, for each time step and grid box. Once a PDF member has been selected, the scheme integrates over the PDF to close higher-order moments, buoyancy terms, and diagnose cloud fraction and liquid water. Since all the diagnosed moments for a given grid box and time step are derived from the same unique joint PDF, they are guaranteed to be consistent with one another.

	Abstract = {A new single-column model for the cloudy boundary layer, described in a companion paper, is tested for a variety of regimes. To represent the subgrid-scale variability, the model uses a joint probability density function (PDF) of vertical velocity, temperature, and moisture content. Results from four different cases are presented and contrasted with large eddy simulations (LES). The cases include a clear convective layer based on the Wangara experiment, a trade wind cumulus layer from the Barbados Oceanographic and Meteorological Experiment (BOMEX), a case of cumulus clouds over land, and a nocturnal marine stratocumulus boundary layer. Results from the Wangara experiment show that the model is capable of realistically predicting the diurnal growth of a dry convective layer. Compared to the LES, the layer produced is slightly less well mixed and entrainment is somewhat slower. The cloud cover in the cloudy cases varied widely, ranging from a few percent cloud cover to nearly overcast. In each of the cloudy cases, the parameterization predicted cloud fractions that agree reasonably well with the LES. Typically, cloud fraction values tended to be somewhat smaller in the parameterization, and cloud bases and tops were slightly underestimated. Liquid water content was generally within 40{\%} of the LES-predicted values for a range of values spanning almost two orders of magnitude. This was accomplished without the use of any case-specific adjustments.},

The SP was based on a two-dimensional (2D) CRM with 64 grid columns and 24 levels collocated with the 24 lowest levels of CAM. In terms of the mean state, the SP-CAM produces quite reasonable geographical distributions of precipitation, precipitable water, top-of-the-atmosphere radiative fluxes, cloud radiative forcing, and high-cloud fraction for both December\&{\#}8211;January\&{\#}8211;February and June\&{\#}8211;July\&{\#}8211;August. The most notable and persistent precipitation bias in the western Pacific, during the Northern Hemisphere summer of all the SP-CAM runs with 2D SP, seems to go away through the use of a small-domain three-dimensional (3D) SP with the same number of grid columns as the 2D SP, but arranged in an 8 {$\times$} 8 square with identical horizontal resolution of 4 km. Two runs with the 3D SP have been carried out, with and without explicit large-scale momentum transport by convection. Interestingly, the double ITCZ feature seems to go away in the run that includes momentum transport. The SP improves the diurnal variability of nondrizzle precipitation frequency over the standard model by precipitating most frequently during late afternoon hours over the land, as observed, while the standard model maximizes its precipitation frequency around local solar noon. Over the ocean, both models precipitate most frequently in the early morning hours as observed. The SP model also reproduces the observed global distribution of the percentage of days with nondrizzle precipitation rather well. In contrast, the standard model tends to precipitate more frequently, on average by about 20{\%}\&{\#}8211;30{\%}. The SP model seems to improve the convective intraseasonal variability over the standard model. Preliminary results suggest that the SP produces more realistic variability of such fields as 200-mb wind and OLR, relative to the control, including the often poorly simulated Madden\&{\#}8211;Julian oscillation (MJO).},

	Abstract = {Multicentury integrations from two global coupled ocean\&{\#}8211;atmosphere\&{\#}8211;land\&{\#}8211;ice models {$[$}Climate Model versions 2.0 (CM2.0) and 2.1 (CM2.1), developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory{$]$} are described in terms of their tropical Pacific climate and El Ni\~no\&{\#}8211;Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The integrations are run without flux adjustments and provide generally realistic simulations of tropical Pacific climate. The observed annual-mean trade winds and precipitation, sea surface temperature, surface heat fluxes, surface currents, Equatorial Undercurrent, and subsurface thermal structure are well captured by the models. Some biases are evident, including a cold SST bias along the equator, a warm bias along the coast of South America, and a westward extension of the trade winds relative to observations. Along the equator, the models exhibit a robust, westward-propagating annual cycle of SST and zonal winds. During boreal spring, excessive rainfall south of the equator is linked to an unrealistic reversal of the simulated meridional winds in the east, and a stronger-than-observed semiannual signal is evident in the zonal winds and Equatorial Undercurrent. Both CM2.0 and CM2.1 have a robust ENSO with multidecadal fluctuations in amplitude, an irregular period between 2 and 5 yr, and a distribution of SST anomalies that is skewed toward warm events as observed. The evolution of subsurface temperature and current anomalies is also quite realistic. However, the simulated SST anomalies are too strong, too weakly damped by surface heat fluxes, and not as clearly phase locked to the end of the calendar year as in observations. The simulated patterns of tropical Pacific SST, wind stress, and precipitation variability are displaced 20{${}^\circ$}\&{\#}8211;30{${}^\circ$} west of the observed patterns, as are the simulated ENSO teleconnections to wintertime 200-hPa heights over Canada and the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Despite this, the impacts of ENSO on summertime and wintertime precipitation outside the tropical Pacific appear to be well simulated. Impacts of the annual-mean biases on the simulated variability are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The authors present three-dimensional numerical simulations of oceanic trade cumulus clouds underlying stratocumulus clouds. The case studied is a Global Energy and Water Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud System Study (GCSS) model intercomparison that is loosely based on observed conditions during the Atlantic Trade Cumulus Experiment (ATEX). It is motivated by the importance of this cloud type to global cloud radiative forcing, and their role as a feeder system for deep convection in the Tropics. This study focuses on the sensitivity of the modeled cloud field to the domain size and the grid spacing. Domain widths from 6.5 to 20 km and horizontal grid spacings ranging from 10 to 80 m, with corresponding vertical grid spacing ranging from 5 to 40 m, are studied, involving massively parallel computations on up to 2.5 billion grid cells. The combination of large domain size and small grid resolution provides an unprecedented perspective on this type of convection. The mean stratocumulus cloud fraction, optical depth, and vertical fluxes of heat, moisture, and momentum are found to be quite sensitive to both the domain size and the resolution. The sensitivities are associated with a strong feedback between cloud fraction, cloud-top radiative cooling, and entrainment. The properties of individual cumulus clouds rising into the stratocumulus are less affected than the stratocumulus clouds. The simulations with 80-m horizontal by 40-m vertical resolution are clearly under-resolved, with distinctly different distributions of liquid water within the clouds. Increasing the resolution to finer than 40 m horizontal/20 m vertical affects the inversion structure and entrainment processes somewhat, but has less impact on the structure of individual clouds. Large-domain simulations exhibit mesoscale structure in the cloud organization and liquid water path. This mesoscale variability feeds back on the domain-mean properties through the cloud-radiative feedback. These simulations suggest that very large computations are required to obtain meaningful cloud statistics for this case.},

@article{Pincus:2005,
	Abstract = {Cloud vertical structure influences the fluxes of precipitation and radiation throughout the atmosphere. This structure is not predicted in large-scale models but is instead applied in the form of "overlap assumptions." In their current guise, overlap assumptions apply to the presence or absence of clouds, and new data sets have led to the development of empirical formulations described by exponential decay from maximum to random overlap over a characteristic length scale. At the same time, cloud parameterizations in many large-scale models have been moving toward "assumed PDF" schemes that predict the distribution of total water within each grid cell, which will require overlap assumptions that may be applied to cells with specified internal variability. This paper uses a month-long cloud-resolving model simulation of continental convection to develop overlap assumptions for use with assumed PDF cloud schemes in large-scale models. An observing system simulation experiment shows that overlap assumptions derived from millimeter-wavelength cloud radar observations can be strongly affected by the presence of precipitation and convective clouds and, to a lesser degree, by limited sampling and reliance on the frozen turbulence assumption. Current representations of overlap can be extended with good accuracy to treat the rank correlation of total water in each grid cell, which provides a natural way to treat vertical structure in assumed PDF cloud schemes. The scale length that describes an exponential fit to the rank correlation of total water depends on the state of the atmosphere: convection is associated with greater vertical coherence (longer scale lengths), while wind shear decreases vertical coherence (shorter scale lengths). The new overlap assumptions are evaluated using cloud physical properties, microphysical process rates, and top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes. These quantities can be reproduced very well when the exact cloud structure is replaced with its statistical equivalent and somewhat less well when the time mean vertical structure is imposed. Overlap formulations that treat total water can also be used to determine the variability in clear-air relative humidity, which might be used by convection and aerosol parameterizations. },

	Abstract = {The present paper deals with the analysis of the time-average relative humidity fields in the atmosphere. Twice-daily estimates of relative humidity are used. After some theoretical considerations on the relations between relative humidity, other moisture parameters, and temperature, a critical analysis of the various sources of data is made considering their possible limitations. Various methods of computing relative humidity are formulated and discussed. The global distribution of relative humidity at various levels shows that it is not zonally uniform with centers of various intensities at all latitudes. The global maps show maxima in the equatorial zone and minima in the dry subtropical belts around 30{${}^\circ$}N and 30{${}^\circ$}S. The land\&{\#}8211;sea contrast and variations related to the orographic relief are also apparent. The general pattern of relative humidity is similar at all levels but its magnitude decreases with altitude. The seasonal analyses show a similar pattern as the annual analyses but are slightly shifted toward the summer pole. The saturation deficit is also evaluated. Cross sections of the saturation deficit show that the maxima are found in the middle to lower troposphere at subtropical latitudes, being most intense in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer season. The temporal variability of the relative humidity due to transient eddies exhibits a bimodal structure with maxima in the midlatitudes of each hemisphere around 700 mb. The stationary eddy distributions are less pronounced than the transient ones and do not change substantially from one season to another. To validate our results, several comparisons are made using independent sources of humidity data as well as cloud distributions at various levels. Thus, COADS data are used to obtain independent analyses of the surface relative humidity over the oceans, and satellite observations by SAGE are used at the 300-mb level. The rawinsonde-SAGE differences are on the order of 10{\%} in the Tropics and 20{\%} in the high latitudes, due in part to a clear-sky (dry) bias in the SAGE data. Our results are further compared with those obtained from operational analyses by the ECMWF. The differences do not exceed 5{\%} in the Tropics but tend to be larger in the tropical upper troposphere and at all levels in the extratropies of the Southern Hemisphere, where the radiosonde network is quite sparse. In view of the obvious connections between the moisture distribution in the atmosphere and cloudiness, a cloud climatology is used to cheek its consistency with the present results. The latitudinal and interseasonal variations of cloudiness and relative humidity are similar, with maxima in the equatorial belt and at high latitudes and minima in the subtropics that shift poleward during summer and equatorward during winter. Finally, some comments are made on the radiosonde-observing systems in the light of recent satellite studies of humidity. Mainly at the upper levels systematic localized differences are found between electrical hygristor and organic sensors, but the differences almost disappear in the middle and lower troposphere. In spite of the shortcomings, limitations, and errors of the radiosonde network, the present analyses describe for the first time the large-scale, three-dimensional characteristics of the relative humidity in the global atmosphere.},

The development of realistic parameterizations of these clouds in global atmospheric models is a major challenge. Unfortunately, this has been a difficult problem to solve in an acceptable way. In this paper, new and simple parameterization schemes for subtropical clouds are implemented in the U.S. Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System's (NOGAPS) forecast model. The parameterizations are partially based on large eddy simulation (LES) results and provide a substantial improvement when compared with observations and with the previous scheme. The global distribution of boundary layer clouds and of surface shortwave radiation is more realistic with this new scheme, particularly over the stratocumulus regions. The transition from stratocumulus to cumulus is well captured, the seasonal and diurnal cycles of stratocumulus are realistic, and the Arctic boundary layer temperature is improved with the new parameterizations.},

The comparison is facilitated by using an ISCCP simulator in the model as a run-time diagnostic package. The results show that in both winter and summer seasons, the model substantially underestimated total cloud amount in the storm tracks and in the subtropical dry regions of the two hemispheres, and it overestimated total cloud amount in the tropical convection centers. The model, however, simulates reasonable cloud radiative forcing at the TOA at different latitudes. The differences of cloud vertical structures and their optical properties are analyzed between the model and the data for three regions selected to represent the storm tracks: the convective Tropics and the subtropical subsidence regions. Major cloud biases are identified as follows: the model overestimated high thin cirrus, high-top optically thick clouds, and low-top optically thick clouds, while it significantly underestimated middle- and low-top clouds with intermediate and small optical thickness. These multiple cloud biases compensate for each other to produce reasonable cloud forcing in the following way: for the longwave cloud forcing, excessive high clouds compensate for significantly deficient middle and low clouds; for the shortwave cloud forcing, excessive optically thick clouds offset significantly deficient optically intermediate and thin clouds. Possible causes of model biases are discussed.},

@article{Norris:2005,
	Abstract = {Daily satellite cloud observations and reanalysis dynamical parameters are analyzed to determine how midtropospheric vertical velocity and advection over the sea surface temperature gradient control midlatitude North Pacific cloud properties. Optically thick clouds with high tops are generated by synoptic ascent, but two different cloud regimes occur under synoptic descent. When vertical motion is downward during summer, extensive stratocumulus cloudiness is associated with near-surface northerly wind, while frequent cloudless pixels occur with southerly wind. Examination of ship-reported cloud types indicates that midlatitude stratocumulus breaks up as the boundary layer decouples when it is advected equatorward over warmer water. Cumulus is prevalent under conditions of synoptic descent and cold advection during winter. Poleward advection of subtropical air over colder water causes stratification of the near-surface layer that inhibits upward mixing of moisture and suppresses cloudiness until a fog eventually forms. Averaging of cloud and radiation data into intervals of 500-hPa vertical velocity and advection over the SST gradient enables the cloud response to changes in temperature and the stratification of the lower troposphere to be investigated independent of the dynamics. Vertically uniform warming results in decreased cloud amount and optical thickness over a large range of dynamical conditions. Further calculations indicate that a decrease in the variance of vertical velocity would lead to a small decrease in mean cloud optical thickness and cloud-top height. These results suggest that reflection of solar radiation back to space by midlatitude oceanic clouds will decrease as a direct response to global warming, thus producing an overall positive feedback on the climate system. An additional decrease in solar reflection would occur were the storm track also to weaken, whereas an intensification of the storm track would partially cancel the cloud response to warming.},

Significant large-scale precipitation appears above a critical temperature and then increases with further increases in temperature. The amount of large-scale precipitation is a function of horizontal resolution and can also be controlled by modifying the convection scheme, as is illustrated here by modifying assumptions concerning entrainment into convective plumes. Significant similarities are found between the behavior of the homogeneous model and that of the Tropics of the parent GCM when ocean temperatures are increased and when the convection scheme is modified.},

	Abstract = {Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas, the most important gaseous source of infrared opacity in the atmosphere. As the concentrations of other greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, increase because of human activity, it is centrally important to predict how the water vapor distribution will be affected. To the extent that water vapor concentrations increase in a warmer world, the climatic effects of the other greenhouse gases will be amplified. Models of the Earth's climate indicate that this is an important positive feedback that increases the sensitivity of surface temperatures to carbon dioxide by nearly a factor of two when considered in isolation from other feedbacks, and possibly by as much as a factor of three or more when interactions with other feedbacks are considered. Critics of this consensus have attempted to provide reasons why modeling results are overestimating the strength of this feedback. Our uncertainty concerning climate sensitivity is disturbing. The range most often quoted for the equilibrium global mean surface temperature response to a doubling of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is 1.5oC to 4.5oC. If the Earth lies near the upper bound of this sensitivity range, climate changes in the twenty-first century will be profound. The range in sensitivity is primarily due to differing assumptions about how the Earth's cloud distribution is maintained; all the models on which these estimates are based possess strong water vapor feedback. If this feedback is, in fact, substantially weaker than predicted in current models, sensitivities in the upper half of this range would be much less likely, a conclusion that would clearly have important policy implications. In this review, we describe the background behind the prevailing view on water vapor feedback and some of the arguments raised by its critics, and attempt to explain why these arguments have not modified the consensus within the climate research community.},

	Abstract = {The responses of the large-scale circulation, clouds, and water vapor to an imposed sea surface temperature (SST) gradient are investigated. Simulations compare reasonably to averaged observations over the Pacific, considering the simplifications applied to the model. The model responses to sinusoidal SST patterns have distinct circulations in the upper and lower troposphere. The upper circulation is sensitive to the heating from deep convection over the warmest SST. Stronger SST gradients are associated with stronger longwave cooling above stratus clouds in the subsidence region, stronger lower-tropospheric large-scale circulation, a reduction of the rain area, and larger area coverage of low clouds. A similar SST gradient with a warmer mean temperature produces slightly weaker lower-tropospheric circulation, and slightly reduced low cloud coverage. The outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is not sensitive to the mean SST or the range of the imposed sinusoidal SST gradient. The positive feedbacks of water vapor and decreasing high cloud OLR compensate for the increase in longwave emission with increasing mean temperature in these simulations. As the SST gradient is increased keeping the mean SST constant, the positive high cloud feedback is still active, but the air temperature increases in proportion to the maximum SST in the domain, increasing the clear-sky OLR value and keeping the average OLR constant. The net absorbed shortwave radiation (SWI) is found to be extremely sensitive to the SST gradient. The stronger lower-tropospheric large-scale circulation produces a higher water content in the high and low clouds, increasing the absolute magnitude of the shortwave cloud forcing. A 25{\%} increase in the maximum zonal mass flux of the lower circulation of the 300-K mean, 4-K SST range simulation leads to a 7.4 W m\&{\#}8722;2 decrease in SWI. Increasing the mean SST creates a positive feedback in these simulations because of the decrease in the lower-tropospheric large-scale circulation and the resultant decrease in cloud optical depth.},

	Abstract = {The responses of tropical clouds and water vapor to SST variations are investigated with simple numerical experiments. The fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University\&{\#}8211;National Center for Atmospheric Research (PSU\&{\#}8211;NCAR) Mesoscale Model is used with doubly periodic boundary conditions and a uniform constant sea surface temperature (SST). The SST is varied and the equilibrium statistics of cloud properties, water vapor, and circulation at different temperatures are compared. The top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes have the same sensitivities to SST as in observations averaged from 20{${}^\circ$}N to 20{${}^\circ$}S over the Pacific, suggesting that the model sensitivities are realistic. As the SST increases, the temperature profile approximately follows a moist-adiabatic lapse rate. The rain rate and cloud ice amounts increase with SST. The average relative humidity profile stays approximately constant, but the upper-tropospheric relative humidity increases slightly with SST. The clear-sky mean temperature and water vapor feedbacks have similar magnitudes to each other and opposite signs. The net clear-sky feedback is thus about equal to the lapse rate feedback, which is about \&{\#}8722;2 W m\&{\#}8722;2 K\&{\#}8722;1. The clear-sky outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) thus increases with SST, but the high cloud-top temperature is almost constant with SST, and the high cloud amount increases with SST. The result of these three effects is an increase of cloud longwave forcing with SST and a mean OLR that is almost independent of SST. The high cloud albedo remains almost constant with increasing SST, but the increase in high cloud area causes a negative shortwave cloud radiative forcing feedback, which partly cancels the longwave cloud feedback. The net radiation decreases slightly with SST, giving a small net negative feedback, implying a stable, but very sensitive climate.},

	Abstract = {The need to understand differences among general circulation model 
projections of CO<SUB>2</SUB>-induced climatic change has motivated the 
present study, which provides an intercomparison and interpretation of 
climate feedback processes in 19 atmospheric general circulation models. 
This intercomparison uses sea surface temperature change as a surrogate 
for climate change. The interpretation of cloud-climate interactions is 
given special attention. A roughly threefold variation in one measure of 
global climate sensitivity is found among the 19 models. The important 
conclusion is that most of this variation is attributable to differences 
in the models' depiction of cloud feedback, a result that emphasizes the 
need for improvements in the treatment of clouds in these models if they 
are ultimately to be used as reliable climate predictors. It is further 
emphasized that cloud feedback is the consequence of all interacting 
physical and dynamical processes in a general circulation model. The 
result of these processes is to produce changes in temperature, moisture 
distribution, and clouds which are integrated into the radiative 
response termed cloud feedback. },

	Abstract = {The western Pacific warm pool experiences the greatest rainfall of any oceanic region on earth. While the SST is everywhere high over the warm pool, there is great spatial and temporal variability in rainfall. Sounding data from the recent TOGA COARE are used to document this variability. In particular, the vertical distributions of heating and moistening at different phases of the 30\&{\#}8211;60 day or intraseasonal oscillation are determined for different areas within the warm pool. While heating and moistening distributions near the equator over the warm pool are often similar to those observed over the western Pacific within the convectively active ITCZ, these profiles do not prevail at all times. In particular, during westerly wind bursts and suppressed, light-wind periods, heating and moistening distributions over the COARE Intensive Flux Array frequently resemble those observed in the trade wind belts. Such profiles are characterized by relatively large negative values of apparent moisture sink Q2 in the lowest 2\&{\#}8211;3 km, reflecting the important moistening effects of shallow, mostly nonprecipitating cumulus clouds. A maximum in moistening commonly occurs in the lower part of the cloud layer during the westerly wind bursts, indicating many \&{\#}8220;forced\&{\#}8221; cumuli that are extensions of boundary-layer turbulence. During suppressed, light-wind periods the moistening peak shifts to the upper part of the cloud layer, indicating a larger proportion of \&{\#}8220;active\&{\#}8221; trade cumulus at that time (consistent with higher SSTs and weaker vertical wind shear). A spectral cloud diagnostic model is used to determine the properties of the shallow cloud fields. Computed profiles of mass fluxes, entrainment, detrainment, and heat and moisture balances during these periods generally resemble those for the western Atlantic trade wind regime. These findings lead to the conclusion that, in association with the intraseasonal oscillation, the western Pacific warm pool boundary layer periodically develops trade-wind-like characteristics with abundant shallow cumulus, and these episodic \&{\#}8220;tradelike\&{\#}8221; regimes are frequent enough to impact the seasonal-mean distributions of boundary layer heating and moistening.},

The major simplification made is to ``relax''the state toward equilibrium each time the parameterization is invoked, rather than requiring that the final state be balanced, as in the original Arakawa-Schubert implementation. This relaxed Arakawa-Schubert (RAS) scheme is evaluated in off-line tests using the Global Atmospheric Research Programme (GARP) Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) Phase III data. The results show that RAS is equivalent to the standard implementation of Arakawa-Schubert but is more economical and simpler to code.

@article{Randall:1989,
	Abstract = {We have analyzed the effects of radiatively active clouds on the climate simulated by the UCLA{\{}sol{\}}GLA GCM, with particular attention to the effects of the upper tropospheric stratiform clouds associated with deep cumulus convection, and the interactions of these clouds with convection and the large-scale circulation. Several numerical experiments have been performed to investigate the mechanisms through which the clouds influence the large-scale circulation. In the {\tt{}"{}}NODETLQ{\tt{}"{}} experiment, no liquid water or ice was detrained from cumulus clouds into the environment; all of the condensate was rained out. Upper level supersaturation cloudiness was drastically reduced, the atmosphere dried, and tropical outgoing longwave radiation increased. In the {\tt{}"{}}NOANVIL{\tt{}"{}} experiment, the radiative effects of the optically thich upper-level cloud sheets associated with deep cumulus convection were neglected. The land surface received more solar radiation in regions of convection, leading to enhanced surface fluxes and a dramatic increase in precipitation. In the {\tt{}"{}}NOCRF{\tt{}"{}} experiment, the longwave atmospheric cloud radiative forcing (ACRF) was omitted, paralleling the recent experiment of Slingo and Slingo. The results suggest that the ACRF enhances deep penetrative convection and precipitation, while suppressing shallow convection. They also indicate that the ACRF warms and moistens the tropical troposphere. The results of this experiment are somewhat ambiguous, however; for example, the ACRF suppresses precipitation in some parts of the tropics, and enhances it in others. To isolate the effects of the ACRF in a simpler setting, we have analyzed the climate of an ocean-covered Earth, which we call Seaworld. The key simplicities of Seaworld are the fixed boundary temperature with no land points, the lack of mountains, and the zonal uniformity of the boundary conditions. Results are presented from two Seaworld simulations. The first includes a full suite of physical parameterizations, while the second omits all radiative effects of the clouds. The differences between the two runs are, therefore, entirely due to the direct and indirect and indirect effects of the ACRF. Results show that the ACRF in the cloudy run accurately represents the radiative heating perturbation relative to the cloud-free run. The cloudy run is warmer in the middle troposphere, contains much more precipitable water, and has about 15{\{}percnt{\}} more globally averaged precipitation. There is a double tropical rain band in the cloud-free run, and a single, more intense tropical rain band in the cloudy run. The cloud-free run produces relatively weak but frequent cumulus convection, while the cloudy run produces relatively intense but infrequent convection. The mean meridional circulation transport nearly twice as much mass in the cloudy run. The increased tropical rising motion in the cloudy run leads to a deeper boundary layer and also to more moisture in the troposphere above the boundary layer. This accounts for the increased precipitable water content of the atmosphere. The clouds lead to an increase in the intensity of the tropical easterlies, and cause the midlatitude westerly jets to shift equatorward. Taken together, our results show that upper tropospheric clouds associated with moist convection, whose importance has recently been emphasized in observational studies, play a very complex and powerful role in determining the model results. This points to a need to develop more realistic parameterizations of these clouds.},

	Abstract = {The formulation and simulation characteristics of two new global coupled climate models developed at NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) are described. The models were designed to simulate atmospheric and oceanic climate and variability from the diurnal time scale through multicentury climate change, given our computational constraints. In particular, an important goal was to use the same model for both experimental seasonal to interannual forecasting and the study of multicentury global climate change, and this goal has been achieved. Two versions of the coupled model are described, called CM2.0 and CM2.1. The versions differ primarily in the dynamical core used in the atmospheric component, along with the cloud tuning and some details of the land and ocean components. For both coupled models, the resolution of the land and atmospheric components is 2-deg latitude * 2.5-deg longitude; the atmospheric model has 24 vertical levels. The ocean resolution is 1-deg in latitude and longitude, with meridional resolution equatorward of 30-deg becoming progressively finer, such that the meridional resolution is 1/3-deg at the equator. There are 50 vertical levels in the ocean, with 22 evenly spaced levels within the top 220 m. The ocean component has poles over North America and Eurasia to avoid polar filtering. Neither coupled model employs flux adjustments. The control simulations have stable, realistic climates when integrated over multiple centuries. Both models have simulations of ENSO that are substantially improved relative to previous GFDL coupled models. The CM2.0 model has been further evaluated as an ENSO forecast model and has good skill (CM2.1 has not been evaluated as an ENSO forecast model). Generally reduced temperature and salinity biases exist in CM2.1 relative to CM2.0. These reductions are associated with 1) improved simulations of surface wind stress in CM2.1 and associated changes in oceanic gyre circulations; 2) changes in cloud tuning and the land model, both of which act to increase the net surface shortwave radiation in CM2.1, thereby reducing an overall cold bias present in CM2.0; and 3) a reduction of ocean lateral viscosity in the extratropics in CM2.1, which reduces sea ice biases in the North Atlantic. Both models have been used to conduct a suite of climate change simulations for the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment report and are able to simulate the main features of the observed warming of the twentieth century. The climate sensitivities of the CM2.0 and CM2.1 models are 2.9 and 3.4 K, respectively. These sensitivities are defined by coupling the atmospheric components of CM2.0 and CM2.1 to a slab ocean model and allowing the model to come into equilibrium with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The output from a suite of integrations conducted with these models is freely available online (see http://nomads.gfdl.noaa.gov/).},

	Abstract = {The Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM3) has recently been developed and released to the climate community. CCSM3 is a coupled climate model with components representing the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, and land surface connected by a flux coupler. CCSM3 is designed to produce realistic simulations over a wide range of spatial resolutions, enabling inexpensive simulations lasting several millennia or detailed studies of continental-scale dynamics, variability, and climate change. This paper will show results from the configuration used for climate-change simulations with a T85 grid for the atmosphere and land and a grid with approximately 1-deg resolution for the ocean and sea ice. The new system incorporates several significant improvements in the physical parameterizations. The enhancements in the model physics are designed to reduce or eliminate several systematic biases in the mean climate produced by previous editions of CCSM. These include new treatments of cloud processes, aerosol radiative forcing, land-atmosphere fluxes, ocean mixed layer processes, and sea ice dynamics. There are significant improvements in the sea ice thickness, polar radiation budgets, tropical sea surface temperatures, and cloud radiative effects. CCSM3 can produce stable climate simulations of millennial duration without ad hoc adjustments to the fluxes exchanged among the component models. Nonetheless, there are still systematic biases in the ocean-atmosphere fluxes in coastal regions west of continents, the spectrum of ENSO variability, the spatial distribution of precipitation in the tropical oceans, and continental precipitation and surface air temperatures. Work is under way to extend CCSM to a more accurate and comprehensive model of the earth's climate system.},

	Abstract = {Observations based on Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) satellite data indicate that there is a near cancellation between tropical longwave and shortwave cloud forcing in regions of deep convective activity. Cloud forcing depends on both cloud macrophysical properties (e.g., cloud amount, cloud height, etc.) and on microphysical properties (e.g., cloud particle size, particle shape, etc.). Hence, the near cancellation in the tropics could be due to either the macrophysical or the microphysical properties of these clouds, or a combination of these effects. By using satellite data from the ERBE and International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and recent in situ observations of tropical anvils, it is argued that the observed near cancellation in the tropics is mainly a result of the tropical tropopause height. This conclusion depends on two observational results from comparison of ERBE and ISCCP data: 1) Both the longwave and shortwave cloud forcing are predominately due to high cloud and 2) these clouds are optically thick in both the visible and infrared region.},

	Abstract = {The climate feedbacks in coupled ocean-atmosphere models are compared using a coordinated set of twenty-first-century climate change experiments. Water vapor is found to provide the largest positive feedback in all models and its strength is consistent with that expected from constant relative humidity changes in the water vapor mixing ratio. The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response. Large intermodel differences in the lapse rate feedback are observed and shown to be associated with differing regional patterns of surface warming. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the vertical changes in temperature and water vapor are tightly coupled in all models and, importantly, demonstrate that intermodel differences in the sum of lapse rate and water vapor feedbacks are small. In contrast, intermodel differences in cloud feedback are found to provide the largest source of uncertainty in current predictions of climate sensitivity.},

The view of the atmospheric general circulation presented here focuses not on Earth's general circulation as such but on a continuum of idealized circulations with axisymmetric flow statistics. Analyses of observational data for Earth's atmosphere, simulations with idealized general circulation models, and theoretical considerations suggest how characteristics of the tropical Hadley circulation, of the extratropical circulation, and of atmospheric macroturbulence may depend on parameters such as the planet radius and rotation rate and the strength of the differential heating at the surface.},

Initial-value integrations with a model with imposed heating are used to discuss aspects of the Asian summer monsoon, including constraints on cross-equatorial flow into the monsoon. The summer descent in the Mediterranean region and on the eastern sides of the summer subtropical anticyclones are seen to be associated with the monsoons to their east. An aqua-planet GCM is used to investigate the relationship between simple SST distributions and tropical convection and circulation. The existence of strong equatorial convection and Hadley cells is found to depend sensitively on the curvature of the meridional profile in SST. Zonally confined SST maxima produce convective maxima centred to the west and suppression of convection elsewhere. Strong equatorial zonal flow changes are found in some experiments and three mechanisms for producing these are investigated in a model with imposed heating.},

	Abstract = {The depth of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is a climatologically important quantity that has received little attention on regional to global scales. Here a 10-yr climatology of PBL depth from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) atmospheric GCM is analyzed using the PBL mass budget. Based on the dominant physical processes, several PBL regimes are identified. These regimes tend to exhibit large-scale geographic organization. Locally generated buoyancy fluxes and static stability control PBL depth nearly everywhere, though convective mass flux has a large influence at tropical marine locations. Virtually all geographical variability in PBL depth can be linearly related to these quantities. While dry convective boundary layers dominate over land, stratocumulus-topped boundary layers are most common over ocean. This division of regimes leads to a dramatic land-sea contrast in PBL depth. Diurnal effects keep mean PBL depth over land shallow despite large daytime surface fluxes. The contrast arises because the large daily exchange of heat and mass between the PBL and free atmosphere over land is not present over the ocean, where mixing is accomplished by turbulent entrainment. Consistent treatment of remnant air from the deep, daytime PBL is necessary for proper representation of this diurnal behavior over land. Many locations exhibit seasonal shifts in PBL regime related to changes in PBL clouds. These shifts are controlled by seasonal variations in buoyancy flux and static stability.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses results from idealized simulations using a non-hydrostatic general circulation model with Cloud-Resolving Convection Parameterization (CRCP, the ?super parameterization?) pertinent to the large-scale organization of tropical convection. The essence of tropical dynamics is the intricate balance between large-scale processes-such as radiative transfer, large-scale waves, monsoons, Hadley and Walker circulations-and the convective dynamics. Traditional approaches to this problem consider either large-scale models using convection parameterization or cloud-resolving models in which large-scale effects are prescribed. The CRCP merges the two approaches. It uses a 2D cloud-resolving model to represent the impact of cloud-scale processes-such as convective motions, precipitation formation and fallout, interaction of clouds with radiative and surface processes-in every column of a large-scale or global model. The global CRCP model is applied to the idealized problem of a rotating constant-SST aquaplanet in convective-radiative equilibrium. The aquaplanet has the size and rate of rotation of the Earth. The global CRCP simulations feature pronounced large-scale organization of convection within the equatorial waveguide. Prominent equatorial ?super cloud clusters? spontaneously develop in CRCP global simulations and bear a strong resemblance to the Madden-Julian Oscillation observed in the terrestrial tropics. Model results suggest that convective transport of zonal momentum, supposedly due to the impact of organized convection, plays a significant role in the large-scale organization of tropical deep convection. },

	Abstract = {Data from a 2025-day Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory aquaplanet GCM integration are used to examine the temporal evolution of the zonal index, defined as the principal component of the first EOF of the zonally and vertically integrated absolute angular momentum. This EOF represents meridional displacements of the subtropical jet. Positive (negative) values of the zonal index correspond to poleward (equatorward) displacements of the subtropical jet and are referred to as the high (low) zonal index. Composites of various quantities are used to examine the temporal evolution of both the zonal-mean zonal winds and the eddy fields associated with either index. The high index is initiated by an enhancement in the equatorward wave activity propagation, which causes the subtropical jet to move in a poleward direction. The low index is led by a weakening in the equatorward propagation, which results in an equatorward displacement of the subtropical jet. More importantly, for the high index, the corresponding increase in eddy forcing is confined to a brief period near onset, resulting in rapid growth and slow decay of the zonal wind anomaly. This suggests that the high index state is {\tt{}"{}}impulsively{\tt{}"{}} forced by the eddies rather than maintained by eddy-zonal mean feedback. In contrast, for the low index, a reduction in the eddy forcing extends throughout the entire persistent episode, although the weakest eddy forcing occurs during onset. The authors believe that such forcing causes the low index anomaly to persist for a longer period of time than the high index anomaly and also results in a similar growth and decay rate for the low index. Furthermore, case studies show that the onset for both indices is associated with wave breaking. For the high (low) index, this wave breaking takes the form of filamentation (blocking).},

A systematic analysis of wave breaking is possible because when a baroclinic wave packet is present, the wave breaking tends to occur in the vicinity of the packet crew. Although the refractive index is strictly valid only for linear, quasigeostrophic flows, in this GCM the refractive index is shown to be useful for categorizing two types of wave breaking. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is performed using the refractive index obtained (by averaging over one carrier wavelength) at the center of the wave packet. Composite Eliassen-Palm fluxes and upper-level potential vorticity, corresponding to either phase of the first EOF of the refractive index, are consistent with the two types of wave breaking. It is found that the strength of the meridional shear in the upper troposphere is related to the type of wave breaking. Implications of these results for storm track variability in the atmosphere are also discussed.},

@article{Lorant:2001,
	Abstract = {Climate simulations using idealized zonally symmetric boundary conditions (an aquaplanet) are performed in order to highlight possible deviations from zonality introduced by the spatial variations in resolution caused by the variable resolution technique. Simulations at three different uniform resolutions with spectral truncations T21, T63, and T106 are used as control simulations, and analyzed in order to describe the zonal climate simulated by this version of the ARPEGE-Climat general circulation model and establish its sensitivity to varying spatial resolution. The model simulates a single equatorial precipitation maximum in which the activity of the convective cells is modulated by westward and eastward propagating equatorial waves, depending on the resolution. A simulation with the variable resolution technique using a truncation T63 and a stretching factor of 3 with the maximum resolution pole placed at the equator is then compared to the uniform resolution simulations. Deviations from the zonally symmetric solution are produced by the sensitivity of tropospheric dynamics and moisture to the local resolution similar to those found at uniform resolution. An unsatisfactory feature of this simulation is the slowing down or reversing of the propagating convective cells in the low-resolution regions, which leads to an intensification of convective precipitation in this region, with the formation of a nonzonal Walker-type circulation in the equatorial plane. Analysis of four other simulations with different truncations and stretching factors (T42s2, T63s3, T95s3, T79s2.5) shows that this deficiency is strongly reduced by increasing the minimal resolution of the stretched grid to be equivalent to T31, which allows a more homogeneous representation of convection over the entire range of resolutions used. The T79s2.5 resolution seems to provide a good choice for producing a reasonable approximation of the zonally symmetric aquaplanet climate.},

@article{Kirtman:2000,
	Abstract = {A series of idealized atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments are presented. These experiments examine whether and how atmospheric deep moist convection, in the absence of meridional gradients in external forcing, interacts with the large-scale flow, becoming spatially organized and yielding a coherent general circulation. In a control simulation, where the SST and the incident solar flux are prescribed to be independent of latitude, longitude, and time, a well-defined intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) forms. This result suggests that the interaction between convection and the rotation of the earth causes convection and a corresponding general circulation to organize. The actual latitude that the ITCZ forms at, however, may be parameterization dependent. In this control simulation, the SST is not interactive and cannot respond to the spatial variations of the heat flux into the ocean that result from the organization of the circulation. In order to examine the circulation that arises without horizontal gradients in the forcing in a physically consistent, energetically closed, model, the AGCM is coupled to a mixed layer ocean model. In this case, the ITCZ still forms at the equator even though a {\tt{}"{}}reversed{\tt{}"{}} pole-to-equator surface temperature gradient develops. The SST distribution and the tropospheric circulation are very different between these two experiments, but the surface zonal mean zonal wind is quite similar. In the Tropics, the surface zonal wind is easterly and in the subtropics it is westerly, implying a net poleward transport of angular momentum in both simulations. Large-scale zonally asymmetric convective {\tt{}"{}}events{\tt{}"{}} apparently produce this momentum transport by the barotropic tilted trough mechanism. The role of three-dimensional zonally asymmetric motions in the momentum transport mechanism is tested in another experiment, where the AGCM is truncated to be zonally symmetric. In this case, the model enters a limit cycle where the ITCZ transits between 20-degN and 20-degS with a 22-month period. The motions associated with this oscillatory behavior accomplish the same poleward transport of angular momentum that the convective events produced in the zonally asymmetric model, but by a drastically different mechanism, suggesting that there may be some undiscovered general principle governing the momentum transport. Finally, a simple argument is used to estimate the minimum modification to the uniform specified SST necessary to displace the ITCZ off the equator. A last experiment verifies this argument.},

	Abstract = {The configuration and performance of a new global atmosphere and land model for climate research developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) are presented. The atmosphere model, known as AM2, includes a new gridpoint dynamical core, a prognostic cloud scheme, and a multispecies aerosol climatology, as well as components from previous models used at GFDL. The land model, known as LM2, includes soil sensible and latent heat storage, groundwater storage, and stomatal resistance. The performance of the coupled model AM2--LM2 is evaluated with a series of prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) simulations. Particular focus is given to the model's climatology and the characteristics of interannual variability related to E1 Ni{\~n}o-- Southern Oscillation (ENSO).
One AM2--LM2 integration was performed according to the prescriptions of the second Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP II) and data were submitted to the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI). Particular strengths of AM2--LM2, as judged by comparison to other models participating in AMIP II, include its circulation and distributions of precipitation. Prominent problems of AM2-- LM2 include a cold bias to surface and tropospheric temperatures, weak tropical cyclone activity, and weak tropical intraseasonal activity associated with the Madden--Julian oscillation.
An ensemble of 10 AM2--LM2 integrations with observed SSTs for the second half of the twentieth century permits a statistically reliable assessment of the model's response to ENSO. In general, AM2--LM2 produces a realistic simulation of the anomalies in tropical precipitation and extratropical circulation that are associated with ENSO.},
